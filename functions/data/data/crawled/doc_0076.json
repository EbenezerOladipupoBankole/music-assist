  "content": "1\nAnd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all\nthe world\nshould be\ntaxed\n.\n2\n(\nAnd\nthis\ntaxing\nwas first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)\n3\nAnd all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\n4\nAnd Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called\nBethlehem\n; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)\n5\nTo be taxed with Mary his\nespoused\nwife, being great with child.\n6\nAnd so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.\n7\nAnd she brought forth her\nfirstborn\nson, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the\ninn\n.\n8\nAnd there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.\n9\nAnd, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the\nglory\nof the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\n10\nAnd the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you\ngood tidings\nof great\njoy\n, which shall be to all people.\n11\nFor unto you is\nborn\nthis day in the city of David a\nSaviour\n, which is Christ the\nLord\n.\n12\nAnd this\nshall be\na\nsign\nunto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\n13\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,\n14\nGlory\nto God in the highest, and on earth\npeace\n, good will toward men.\n15\nAnd it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.\n16\nAnd they came with\nhaste\n, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.\n17\nAnd when they had seen\nit,\nthey made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.\n18\nAnd all they that heard\nit\nwondered\nat those things which were told them by the shepherds.\n19\nBut Mary kept all these things, and\npondered\nthem\nin her heart.\n20\nAnd the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\n21\nAnd when eight days were accomplished for the\ncircumcising\nof the child, his name was called\nJesus\n, which was so\nnamed\nof the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\n22\nAnd when the days of her\npurification\naccording to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present\nhim\nto the Lord;\n23\n(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the\nwomb\nshall be called holy to the Lord;)\n24\nAnd to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of\nturtledoves\n, or two young pigeons.\n25\nAnd, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name\nwas\nSimeon; and the same man\nwas\njust and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.\n26\nAnd it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.\n27\nAnd he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,\n28\nThen took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,\n29\nLord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:\n30\nFor mine eyes have seen thy\nsalvation\n,\n31\nWhich thou hast prepared before the face of all people;\n32\nA\nlight\nto lighten\nthe Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.\n33\nAnd Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.\n34\nAnd Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this\nchild\nis\nset\nfor the\nfall\nand rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;\n35\n(Yea, a sword shall\npierce\nthrough thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\n36\nAnd there was one Anna, a\nprophetess\n, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;\n37\nAnd she\nwas\na widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served\nGod\nwith\nfastings\nand prayers night and day.\n38\nAnd she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for\nredemption\nin Jerusalem.\n39\nAnd when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.\n40\nAnd the child grew, and\nwaxed\nstrong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the\ngrace\nof God was upon him.\n41\nNow his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the\nfeast of the passover\n.\n42\nAnd when he was twelve years\nold, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.\n43\nAnd when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not\nof it.\n44\nBut they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among\ntheir\nkinsfolk and acquaintance.\n45\nAnd when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.\n46\nAnd it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the\ntemple\n, sitting in the midst of the\ndoctors\n,\nboth\nhearing them, and\nasking\nthem questions.\n47\nAnd all that heard him were astonished at his\nunderstanding\nand answers.\n48\nAnd when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\n49\nAnd he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?\nwist\nye not that I must be about my\nFather’s\nbusiness?\n50\nAnd they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.\n51\nAnd he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was\nsubject\nunto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her\nheart\n.\n52\nAnd Jesus\nincreased\nin\nwisdom\nand stature, and in\nfavour\nwith God and man.",
