  "content": "Expressively\nHow could the Father tell the world of love and tenderness?\nHe sent his Son, a newborn babe, with peace and holiness.\nHow could the Father show the world the pathway we should go?\nHe sent his Son to walk with men on earth, that we may know.\nHow could the Father tell the world of sacrifice, of death?\nHe sent his Son to die for us and rise with living breath.\nWhat does the Father ask of us? What do the scriptures say?\nHave faith, have hope, live like his Son, help others on their way.\nWhat does he ask? Live like his Son.\nWords:\nMabel Jones Gabbott, 1910–2004\nMusic:\nMichael Finlinson Moody, b. 1941\n© 1982 by Mabel Jones Gabbott and Michael Finlinson Moody. Arr. © 1989 IRI.
