All glory to his name!\nHe lives, my Savior, still the same.\nOh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:\n“I know that my Redeemer lives!”\nHe lives! All glory to his name!\nHe lives, my Savior, still the same.\nOh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:\n“I know that my Redeemer lives!”\nText:\nSamuel Medley, 1738–1799\nMusic:\nLewis D.
