Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or\nleprous\n, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will\nheal\nthem, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.\n8\nFor I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your\nfaith\nis\nsufficient\nthat I should heal you.\n9\nAnd it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their\nblind\n, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.\n10\nAnd they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did\nkiss\nhis feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.\n11\nAnd it came to pass that he commanded that their\nlittle children\nshould be brought.\n12\nSo they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.\n13\nAnd it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should\nkneel\ndown upon the ground.\n14\nAnd it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am\ntroubled\nbecause of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.\n15\nAnd when he had said these words, he himself also\nknelt\nupon the earth; and behold he\nprayed\nunto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.\n16\nAnd after this manner do they bear record: The\neye\nhath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;\n17\nAnd no\ntongue\ncan speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.\n18\nAnd it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the\njoy\nof the multitude that they were overcome.\n19\nAnd it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.\n20\nAnd they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And\nnow\nbehold, my joy is full.\n21\nAnd when he had said these words, he\nwept\n, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and\nblessed\nthem, and prayed unto the Father for them.\n22\nAnd when he had done this he wept again;\n23\nAnd he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.\n24\nAnd as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and\nencircled\nthose little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.\n25\nAnd the multitude did see and\nhear\nand bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.",
