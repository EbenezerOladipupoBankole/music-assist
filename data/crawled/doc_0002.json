  "content": "Common Questions About Music in Church Meetings\nHymns and music are important in Church meetings, homes, and personal lives. The Lord said, “The song of the righteous is a prayer unto me” (Doctrine and Covenants 25:12). The First Presidency emphasized that hymns invite the Spirit, create reverence, and unify members. They also noted that music can move families toward spirituality, lift spirits, give courage, and bring peace.\nOn This Page\nSelecting Music for Worship Meetings\nMusic in Second-Hour Meetings\nMusical Instruments\nServing in Church Music\nChoirs\nSelecting Music for Worship Meetings\nWhen will the Church publish a new hymnbook (or children’s songbook)?\nThe hymnbook and children’s songbook are currently under revision. Development is expected to take several years as the committees coordinate together, considering both new and existing hymns and songs for inclusion. Translation of the books will begin after that work is complete. Learn more\nhere\n.\nWho selects music for Church meetings?\n“The bishop is responsible for ward music. He may assign this responsibility to one of his counselors. Bishoprics have the following responsibilities: ...\nWork with the ward music coordinator to plan music for sacrament meetings (see\n19.3.1\n)” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.4.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n“The ward music coordinator serves under the direction of the bishopric. He or she has the following responsibilities:\nBe a resource to the bishopric and other ward leaders on music matters. Attend ward council meeting as invited by the bishop to help coordinate music in the ward.\nWork with the bishopric to plan music for sacrament meetings (see\n19.3.1\nand\n19.3.2\n)” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.4.2\n).\nHow do I know what music is “appropriate” for worship meetings?\n“All music in Church meetings should be presented in the spirit of worship of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, not as a performance to showcase musical talent.\n“Musical selections should be consistent with the worshipful spirit of the hymns. They should teach the gospel with power and clarity” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n“And their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done” (\nMoroni 6:9\n).\nRather than thinking of music as inherently “appropriate” or not, bishoprics and ward music coordinators should consider the principles outlined in the\nGeneral Handbook\n. They should also seek the Spirit’s direction, with their specific congregations and meetings in mind.\nAre hymns the only music that can be used in sacrament meeting?\n“Hymns are used for all congregational singing in worship services. Hymns or other sacred musical selections may be used for prelude and postlude music, choir music, and solo or small group presentations. All music in Church meetings should be presented in the spirit of worship of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, not as a performance to showcase musical talent.\n“Musical selections should be consistent with the worshipful spirit of the hymns. They should teach the gospel with power and clarity” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). (See also “\nHymns for Congregations\n,”\nHymns\n, 380–81.)\nWhat culturally inclusive music may be used in sacrament meeting?\nMusic that may be culturally inclusive and unifying for one congregation may not be as suitable for another. Bishoprics and ward music coordinators should consider the demographics and cultures represented in their congregations. They should also seek the direction of the Spirit when planning music for worship meetings. The general principles in\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3\n, provide guidance for selecting music for worship in all congregations.\nShould we sing only those hymns that are familiar to our congregation?\n“Music coordinators and bishoprics try to find a balance between familiar and less-familiar hymns. Musical selections presented by the ward choir or others can help members become more familiar with hymns that are not as well known” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). (See also “Using the Hymnbook,”\nHymns\n,\n381\n.)\n“A library of sheet music and music recordings for use at home and at church is available on the Sacred Music app and online at\nmusic.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Listening to recordings can help members become more familiar with the hymns.\n“The interactive music player on ChurchofJesusChrist.org can help those seeking to learn new music or develop music skills” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.6\n).\nIs there an official list of “banned” or “approved” music or composers for sacrament meeting?\nNo. Music coordinators and priesthood leaders should review the general principle-based guidelines (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.1\n,\n19.3.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org) and then, with the guidance of the Spirit, apply the guidelines to a particular circumstance.\nShould we choose sacrament hymns only from the “Sacrament” section in the hymnbook’s table of contents?\nHymns throughout the hymnbook may be used as sacrament hymns if they follow this guideline: “The sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). For more information, see “\nHymns for Congregations\n,”\nHymns\n, 380–81.\nWhich verses of a hymn should we sing in worship meetings?\nAs music coordinators and bishoprics plan music for meetings, they consider which verses will best meet the purposes of the meeting and the needs of the congregation. Intentionally planning the use of music in meetings will help create rich opportunities for the Spirit to testify to members according to their needs.\n“You need not feel compelled to sing all the verses of a hymn unless the message is otherwise incomplete. However, do not routinely shorten a hymn by singing just the first one or two verses. Singing the verses printed below the music is encouraged” (“Using the Hymnbook,”\nHymns\n,\n381\n).\nAre musical programs allowed in sacrament meeting for Easter, Christmas, and so on?\nAs bishoprics and ward music coordinators plan music for worship, they may work with other ward leaders, such as choir directors and Primary presidencies, to plan occasional meetings that feature more music than a normal worship service. Although “musical programs” are no longer addressed in the\nGeneral Handbook\n, these sections should still provide guidance for such occasions:\n“Planning Music for Church Meetings,”\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n“Music in Sacrament Meeting,”\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.2\nMusic in Second-Hour Meetings\nWhat are the guidelines for music in classes and quorum meetings?\n“Singing hymns can be an effective way to introduce or reinforce gospel principles. Leaders encourage teachers to use the hymns and other sacred music to enhance their teaching.\n“Sunday quorum meetings and classes do not routinely begin with an opening hymn” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.3\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nCan songs not published by the Church be used in Primary?\n“The music leader and pianist teach children the gospel of Jesus Christ through music during singing time. Music reinforces weekly study of the scriptures as outlined in\nCome, Follow Me\n. The following resources may be used:\nCome, Follow Me\nHymns—For Home and Church\nInstructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament\nMeeting Program\nChildren’s Songbook\nHymns\nPrimary Music Collections\non ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n“Primary Singing Time—Music Can Teach Doctrine”\n(MediaLibrary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org)\n“The bishopric must approve the use of any other music in Primary” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n12.3.4\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nMusical Instruments\nMay instruments other than the piano or organ be used in sacrament meeting?\n“Live instruments are normally used for prelude and postlude music and for hymn accompaniment in Church meetings. Where they are available and where members can play them, organs and pianos are the standard instruments. Bishoprics may approve the use of other instruments to accompany congregational singing, for prelude and postlude music, and in other musical selections.\n“Musical instruments should convey a feeling of worship and be played in keeping with the spirit of the meeting.\n“If a piano, organ, or accompanist is not available, recordings may be used” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.6\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n“The piano, organ, or another instrument approved by the bishopric may be used to accompany hymn singing in sacrament meeting” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.2\n).\nCan recorded accompaniment be used for music in sacrament meetings?\n“If a piano, organ, or accompanist is not available, recordings may be used” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.6\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\n“All music in Church meetings should be presented in the spirit of worship of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, not as a performance to showcase musical talent” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.1\n).\nWho is responsible for keeping the musical instruments tuned and in repair? What is the procedure?\n“Pianos are tuned and organs are maintained regularly. The bishop or the stake building representative can contact the facilities manager with questions. As needed, he can also submit a request in Facility Issue Reporting (FIR) to maintain and repair pianos and organs” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.6.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nMay meetinghouse organs and pianos be used for paid private instruction? What about recitals?\n“When there is not a reasonable alternative, priesthood leaders may authorize the use of meetinghouse pianos and organs for practice, paid private instruction, and recitals involving members of the units that use the meetinghouse. … No admittance fee should be charged for recitals” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.7.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nServing in Church Music\nCan nonmembers have music callings?\n“In wards that are large enough, the bishopric may call members to serve in [some music] callings. Youth and those of other faiths may be called to serve. Bishoprics may adapt these callings as necessary to meet the needs of their ward” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.4.3\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nCan we have someone come to our area to do a workshop or seminar?\n“Where there are enough members, music coordinators may consult with priesthood leaders and recommend organizing stake or multistake training workshops. No fee is charged for Church-sponsored training” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.6\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nChoirs\nAre ward choirs no longer necessary in each ward?\nWard choirs are a source of rich spiritual blessings for choir members and congregations. The Lord has said, “The song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:12\n). Bishops and branch presidents are encouraged to seek the guidance of the Spirit as they consider whether there are enough members and resources to create and maintain choirs in their units.\n“Where there are enough members, wards may organize choirs that sing in sacrament meeting regularly” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.7.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nHow are choir members selected?\n“Ward members may volunteer to sing in the choir. Members and others may also be invited to participate. Auditions are not held” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.7.1\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nWhat are the guidelines regarding multistake choirs?\n“With the approval of stake or area leaders, stake and multistake choirs may be organized for stake conferences and other occasions, such as community events. After the meeting or event, the choir is disbanded until other occasions arise” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n19.3.7.2\n, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nLast Updated On 17 Sep 2025",
