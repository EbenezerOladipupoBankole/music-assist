  "content": "Thoughtfully\n1.\nI love to see the temple.\nI’m going there someday\nTo feel the Holy Spirit,\nTo listen and to pray.\nFor the temple is a house of God,\nA place of love and beauty.\nI’ll prepare myself while I am young;\nThis is my sacred duty.\n2.\nI love to see the temple.\nI’ll go inside someday.\nI’ll cov’nant with my Father;\nI’ll promise to obey.\nFor the temple is a holy place\nWhere we are sealed together.\nAs a child of God, I’ve learned this truth:\nA fam’ly is forever.\nWords and music:\nJanice Kapp Perry, b. 1938\n© 1980 by Janice Kapp Perry. This song may be copied for incidental, noncommercial church or home use.\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:39–41",
