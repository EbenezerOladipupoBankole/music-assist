  "content": "1\nAnd then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O\nbarren\n, thou that didst not bear; break forth into\nsinging\n, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the\ndesolate\nthan the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.\n2\nEnlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy\nstakes\n;\n3\nFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall\ninherit\nthe\nGentiles\nand make the desolate cities to be inhabited.\n4\nFear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to\nshame\n; for thou shalt forget the\nshame\nof thy youth, and shalt not remember the\nreproach\nof thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.\n5\nFor thy maker, thy\nhusband\n, the Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel—the God of the whole earth shall he be called.\n6\nFor the Lord hath called thee\nas\na woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.\n7\nFor a small moment have I\nforsaken\nthee, but with great mercies will I gather thee.\n8\nIn a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting\nkindness\nwill I have\nmercy\non thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.\n9\nFor\nthis\n, the\nwaters of Noah\nunto me, for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee.\n10\nFor the\nmountains\nshall depart and the hills be removed, but my\nkindness\nshall not\ndepart\nfrom thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.\n11\nO thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold, I will lay thy\nstones\nwith fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.\n12\nAnd I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\n13\nAnd\nall\nthy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the\npeace\nof thy children.\n14\nIn\nrighteousness\nshalt thou be established; thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear, and from terror for it shall not come near thee.\n15\nBehold, they shall surely gather together\nagainst\nthee, not by me; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.\n16\nBehold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.\n17\nNo weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the\nservants\nof the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.",
