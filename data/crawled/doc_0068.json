Choose the right!\nLet wisdom mark the way before.\nIn its light, choose the right!\nAnd God will bless you evermore.\n2.\nChoose the right! Let no spirit of digression\nOvercome you in the evil hour.\nThere’s the right and the wrong to ev’ry question;\nBe safe thru inspiration’s pow’r.\n[Chorus]\nChoose the right! Choose the right!\nLet wisdom mark the way before.\nIn its light, choose the right!\nAnd God will bless you evermore.\n3.\nChoose the right! There is peace in righteous doing.\nChoose the right! There’s safety for the soul.\nChoose the right in all labors you’re pursuing;\nLet God and heaven be your goal.\n[Chorus]\nChoose the right! Choose the right!\nLet wisdom mark the way before.\nIn its light, choose the right!\nAnd God will bless you evermore.\nText:\nJoseph L. Townsend, 1849–1942\nMusic:\nHenry A.
