Introductory Overview,”\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nThe Lord taught, “Let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:99\n). As a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you should seek personal revelation to help you learn and fulfill the duties of your calling.\nStudying the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets will help you understand and fulfill your duties. As you study the words of God, you will be more receptive to the influence of the Spirit (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:85\n).\nYou also learn your duties by studying the instructions in this handbook. These instructions can invite revelation if they are used to provide an understanding of principles, policies, and procedures to apply while seeking the guidance of the Spirit.\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nprovides guidance for general and local Church leaders. It is divided into sections:\nDoctrinal Foundation:\nThese chapters present doctrine and principles fundamental to serving in the Church. They explain:\nGod’s plan of happiness, His work of salvation and exaltation, and the purpose of the Church.\nThe role of the family in God’s plan, His work of salvation and exaltation in the home, and the relationship between the home and the Church.\nPriesthood principles.\nPrinciples for leading in the Savior’s Church.\nChurch Organization:\nThese chapters provide instructions for stake presidencies and bishoprics, priesthood quorum leaders, stake and ward organization leaders, and others who serve in the Church.\nGod’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation:\nThese chapters instruct on the core work of the Church:\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ\nCaring for those in need\nInviting all to receive the gospel\nUniting families for eternity\nChurch Administration:\nThese chapters present additional guidelines for administering the Church. Subjects include meetings, callings, records, finances, and policies.\nThe headings and subheadings in this handbook are numbered to make topics easy to find and reference. For example, instruction about who may be sealed in a temple is provided in\n27.3.1\n. The number\n27\nrefers to the chapter, the number\n3\nrefers to a section in that chapter, and the number\n1\nrefers to a subsection.\nNot all stakes and wards have the same needs. This handbook contains guidelines for adaptation as well as optional resources:\nGuidelines for adaptation\n(\n) provide direction on how to adapt Church organizations and programs to units with differing needs and resources.\nOptional resources\n(\n) contain additional information and direction that may be helpful to stake and ward leaders.\nLeaders seek inspiration about which guidelines and optional resources to use to meet members’ needs.\nThis handbook will be updated periodically. A list of recent changes is available in the “\nSummary of Recent Updates\n.”\nWhen questions arise that are not addressed in the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, or this handbook, Church members should rely on their covenants with God, the counsel of their local leaders, and the inspiration of the Spirit for guidance.\nIf leaders have questions about information in this handbook or about issues it does not address, they counsel with their immediate presiding authority.\nExcept where indicated otherwise:\nThe terms\nbishop\nand\nbishopric\nin this handbook refer also to branch presidents and branch presidencies. The terms\nstake president\nand\nstake presidency\nrefer also to district presidents and district presidencies. For a summary of how the authority of district presidents differs from that of stake presidents, see\n6.3\n.\nReferences to wards and stakes generally also apply to branches, districts, and missions.\nReferences to Sunday apply to whichever day the Sabbath is observed locally.\nThe term\nunit\nrefers to wards and branches.\nReferences to parents generally also apply to legal guardians.\nThe callings of bishop and branch president are not equivalent in authority and responsibility, nor are the callings of stake president and district president. The bishop is an office in the priesthood, and ordination is authorized only by the First Presidency. Stake presidents are called by General Authorities and Area Seventies.\nSome chapters in this handbook include instructions to contact Church headquarters or the area office. The instruction to contact Church headquarters applies to those in the United States and Canada. The instruction to contact the area office applies to those outside the United States and Canada.",
