Church Policies and Guidelines,”\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nOur Father in Heaven loves His children. “All are alike unto God,” and He invites all “to come unto him and partake of his goodness” (\n2 Nephi 26:33\n).\nChurch leaders and members are often asked who can attend meetings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who can become Church members, and who can attend a temple.\nThe Savior taught that His disciples should love their neighbors (see\nMatthew 22:39\n). Paul invited new converts to “no more be strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints” (\nEphesians 2:19\n). The Savior also taught that Church members are not to “cast any one out from … public meetings, which are held before the world” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:3\n).\nAll are welcome to attend sacrament meeting, other Sunday meetings, and social events of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The presiding officer is responsible to ensure that all who attend are respectful of the sacred setting.\nThose who attend should avoid disruptions or distractions contrary to worship or other purposes of the meeting. All age and behavior requirements of different Church meetings and events should be respected. That requires refraining from overt romantic behavior and from dress or grooming that causes distraction. It also precludes making political statements or speaking of sexual orientation or other personal characteristics in a way that detracts from meetings focused on the Savior.\nIf there is inappropriate behavior, the bishop or stake president gives private counsel in a spirit of love. He encourages those whose behavior is improper for the occasion to focus on helping maintain a sacred space for everyone present with a special emphasis on worshipping Heavenly Father and the Savior.\nChurch meetinghouses remain private property subject to Church policies. Persons unwilling to follow these guidelines will be asked in a respectful way not to attend Church meetings and events.\nMembership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is available to people who “come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits,” “are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ,” and desire to make and keep sacred baptismal covenants (\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n).\nFor baptism of minor children ages 8 and older, see\n38.2.8.2\n.\nTemples are holy places of worship in which essential ordinances are received and sacred covenants are made. To members of the Church, temples are houses of God. Because of this sacredness and the covenants made, only members of the Church with a current temple recommend may worship in the temple. Members may receive a temple recommend when they faithfully keep the required commandments and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. (See\nchapter 26\n.)\nAll members, even if they have never married or are without family in the Church, should strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to be sealed as a worthy husband or wife and to become a loving father or mother. For some, these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.\nFaithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants they have made with God (see\nMosiah 2:41\n).\nAn unwed young man under age 18 who is going to become a father may participate in his Aaronic Priesthood quorum or in the elders quorum. This decision is left to the prayerful discretion of the young man, his parents, and the bishop.\nAn unwed young woman under age 18 who is going to become a mother may participate in Young Women or in Relief Society. This decision is left to the prayerful discretion of the young woman, her parents, and the bishop.\nIn making this decision, youth, parents, and leaders consider the following:\nIf the youth participates in youth classes and activities, the child should not accompany him or her.\nOlder youth who choose to raise the child may benefit from being welcomed into the elders quorum as prospective elders or into Relief Society.\nThis section gives policies for ordinances and blessings. Some of these policies involve special circumstances. General information about ordinances and blessings is provided in\nchapter 18\n. Information about temple ordinances is provided in\nchapters 27\nand\n28\n.\nIt is important that a person who receives an ordinance or blessing understands what is said. If necessary, a presiding leader may ask someone to interpret an ordinance or blessing into a language that the recipient understands. This includes sign language interpretation.\nIf a person receiving an ordinance or blessing is deaf or hard of hearing, he or she may use a voice-to-text application. Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing may also use sign language interpretation or a voice-to-text application to understand the blessings given to their family members.\nFor information about written translations of patriarchal blessings, see\n38.2.10.5\n. For information about sign language interpretation of patriarchal blessings, see\n38.2.10.6\n.\nOrdinances and blessings are sacred. For this reason, no one should take photographs or make video recordings of ordinances, blessings, or baptismal services.\nA family may make an audio recording and transcription of father’s blessings. These blessings are described in\n18.14.1\n.\nPatriarchal blessings are transcribed. To facilitate this, the patriarch or his scribe makes an audio recording of the blessing.\nOther ordinances and blessings should not be recorded or transcribed.\nFor information about streaming ordinances, see\n38.2.3\n.\nWhen possible, those who want to view an ordinance should strive to attend in person. When members and friends gather for an ordinance, they feel the influence of the Spirit and fellowship with one another.\nHowever, when a close family member is not able to attend in person, the bishop or stake president may authorize streaming the ordinance to him or her. Streaming is permitted, for example, when the close family member:\nLives in a remote location or has limited ability to travel.\nHas physical, mental, or emotional health challenges.\nIs immunocompromised or in a care facility or hospital.\nNeeds sign-language interpretation.\nIs serving a full-time mission. (The mission president’s approval is required.)\nThe bishop may authorize the streaming of baby blessings, baptisms, confirmations, and Aaronic Priesthood ordinations. The stake president may authorize the streaming of Melchizedek Priesthood ordinations and the setting apart of missionaries.\nThe ordinance of the sacrament is not streamed. If a sacrament meeting is being livestreamed, the stream should be paused during the administration of the sacrament. The bishop may authorize a priest or Melchizedek Priesthood holder to administer the sacrament in person to those who cannot attend the meeting (see\n18.9.1\n).\nStreaming of ordinances should not distract from the Spirit. Generally, only one device should be used. It is operated by the ward or stake technology specialist. Both the device and the person using it should be inconspicuous.\nStreams of ordinances should be deleted within one day after the ordinance.\nWhen considering whether to perform ordinances for a person who has an intellectual disability, the individual, his or her parents or guardians (where applicable), and leaders counsel together. They prayerfully consider the person’s desire and degree of understanding. Ordinances should not be withheld if the person is worthy, wants to receive them, and shows sufficient responsibility and accountability.\nThe bishop may counsel with the stake president if he has questions about specific persons. The stake president may contact the Office of the First Presidency if necessary.\nIndividuals whose disabilities make them not accountable are “saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 137:10\n). For this reason, ordinances are not needed or performed for them. The only exception is sealing to parents for those who were not born in the covenant.\nFor information about performing ordinances for those with intellectual disabilities, see the following:\nFor baptism and confirmation,\n38.2.8.1\nFor ordination to a priesthood office,\n38.2.9.7\nFor a patriarchal blessing,\n38.2.10.1\nFor the temple endowment and sealing,\n27.2.1.3\nand\n27.3.1.2\nPersons who have physical disabilities, such as the loss of limbs, paralysis, or deafness, may perform and receive ordinances and blessings. Leaders make arrangements so these persons can participate to the extent possible. If leaders have questions they cannot resolve, the stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency.\nPersons who are deaf or hard of hearing may communicate through sign language when performing or receiving an ordinance or blessing. A priesthood leader who oversees an ordinance ensures that the recipient understands it through an interpreter or by other means (see\n38.2.1\n).\nThe information below gives reasons an ordinance would not be valid. It also describes how to validate or ratify the ordinance.\nIn some cases, an ordinance must be performed again. When this happens with a baptism and confirmation or a priesthood ordination, a clerk records the new date on the membership record, even if it is out of sequence with the dates of other ordinances.\nMembers may not repeat living temple ordinances without First Presidency approval (see\n38.2.6.2\n).\nFor record-keeping purposes, a baptism and confirmation or a priesthood ordination is considered not valid if the year it was performed is missing or incorrect on the membership record. In addition, a baptism is not valid if a membership record was not created. The ordinance can be validated with the original certificate that was issued when the ordinance was performed. With this certificate, the bishop can authorize a clerk to update the membership record.\nIf the certificate cannot be found, the baptism and confirmation or the priesthood ordination can be validated with the testimony of two people who witnessed it. The two witnesses should:\nHave been 8 years old or older when the ordinance was performed.\nHave seen or heard the ordinance.\nBe Church members of record at the time they give their testimony.\nGive their testimony in writing, stating either (1) the complete date the ordinance was performed or (2) the year it was performed and the person who performed it.\nSign their testimony in the presence of a member of the bishopric or stake presidency.\nWith this testimony, the bishop can authorize a clerk to create or update the membership record. The written testimony may then be discarded.\nIf the certificate or witnesses cannot be found, the baptism and confirmation or the priesthood ordination must be performed again or ratified by the First Presidency.\nIf the member has received other ordinances after the invalid ordinance, they must be ratified by the First Presidency. The stake president uses LCR to submit the request.\nFor information about validating an ordinance that a member received in the temple, see\n38.2.6.2\n.\nIf a living person’s temple ordinance information is incorrect or missing from his or her membership record, local leaders should record the date and, if available, the location of the original ordinance using LCR. The Temple Department then verifies the temple ordinance and connects it to the membership record.\nIf the temple ordinance cannot be verified, the Temple Department will contact the Office of the First Presidency and give instruction to the local leader.\nMembers may not repeat a living temple ordinance without First Presidency approval.\nAn ordinance is not valid if a person received it out of sequence. For example, a man’s endowment is not valid if he received it before receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood. However, the First Presidency may ratify such an ordinance. The stake president uses LCR to submit the request.\nAn ordinance is not valid if it was performed before the appropriate age. For example, a baptism is not valid if it was performed before the person was 8 years old.\nIf no other ordinances were received after the invalid ordinance, a baptism and confirmation or a priesthood ordination should be performed again or ratified by the First Presidency. Members may not repeat a living temple ordinance without First Presidency approval (see 38.2.6.2).\nIf other ordinances were received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. The stake president uses LCR to submit the request.\nAn ordinance is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not have the proper priesthood authority. For example, a confirmation is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Similarly, it is not valid if the person performing it received the Melchizedek Priesthood out of sequence or without proper approval (see\n38.2.6.3\n; see also\n32.17\n).\nIf no other ordinances were received after the invalid ordinance, it should be performed again by someone with the proper authority. If other ordinances were received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. In some cases, the First Presidency may instruct that ordinances be performed again.\nFor general information about naming and blessing children, see\n18.6\n.\nIf a newborn is critically ill, a Melchizedek Priesthood holder may perform the naming and blessing in the hospital or at home. He does not need authorization from the bishop. After giving the blessing, he notifies the bishop promptly so a membership record can be created for the child.\nA child may be blessed when the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the blessing.\nSometimes a child’s parents or guardians request that the child be blessed even though they are not members of the Church. When this happens, the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the blessing.\nThe bishop explains that:\nA membership record will be created for the child.\nWard members will contact them periodically.\nHe or other ward leaders will propose that the child prepare to be baptized as he or she approaches age 8.\nFor general information about baptism and confirmation, see\n18.7\nand\n18.8\n.\nA person with an intellectual disability may be baptized and confirmed if he or she can reasonably be considered accountable. He or she should be able to understand and keep the covenants of baptism.\nThe bishop holds the keys for the person’s baptism if he or she is:\nA member of record age 8 or older.\nAge 8 and has at least one member parent or guardian (see\n18.7.1.1\n).\nThe person, his or her parents or guardians (where applicable), and the bishop counsel together to determine whether the person should be baptized and confirmed.\nIf the person is a potential convert, the mission president holds the keys for his or her baptism (see\n18.7.1.2\n). In this case, the missionaries inform the mission president. He counsels with the person and his or her parents or guardians (where applicable) to determine whether he or she should be baptized and confirmed. If the bishop knows the person well, the mission president may also seek his input.\nThose who are not accountable do not need to be baptized, regardless of age (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:46–50\nand\n38.2.4\nin this handbook).\nFor information about the membership records of persons who may not be accountable, see\n33.6.10\n.\nA minor, as defined by local laws, may be baptized when both of the following conditions are met:\nThe parents or legal guardians give permission. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the baptism. Exceptions require the approval of the First Presidency.\nThe person who conducts the baptism and confirmation interview asks for this permission to be in writing if he feels it will help prevent misunderstandings. In some locations, written permission is required. Mission and area leaders can provide guidance.\nParents or guardians should understand the doctrine their child will be taught. They should also be willing to support the child in making and keeping the baptismal covenant.\nThe person who conducts the interview discerns that the child understands the baptismal covenant. He should feel confident that the child will strive to keep this covenant by obeying the commandments, including attending Church meetings.\nIf a child goes by the surname of his or her stepfather, the child may be baptized and confirmed in that name. This is true even if he or she has not been formally adopted. However, the child’s legal name, as defined by local law or custom, should be recorded on the membership record and the baptism and confirmation certificate.\nA married person must have the consent of his or her spouse before being baptized.\nA couple living together but not married must commit to living the law of chastity before either of them can be baptized. This includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n. It also includes no longer living together or, in the case of a man and a woman, getting married.\nPersons whose Church membership was withdrawn or who resigned membership may be readmitted by baptism and confirmation. They are not considered converts. Missionaries do not interview them for baptism. For instructions, see\n32.16\n.\nAuthorization from the mission president is required before a person can be baptized if he or she has ever:\nCommitted a serious crime (see\n38.2.8.7\n).\nParticipated in an abortion (see\n38.6.1\n).\nIn these cases, the mission president interviews the person. If necessary, the mission president may authorize one of his counselors to conduct the interview. He gives this authorization separately for each interview. The counselor who conducts it reports to the mission president, who may then authorize or deny the baptism and confirmation.\nApproval from the First Presidency is required before a person can be baptized and confirmed if he or she:\nHas committed murder (see\n38.2.8.7\n).\nHas been convicted of a crime involving sexual misconduct (see\n38.2.8.7\n).\nIs currently on legal probation or parole for any serious crime or offense (usually punishable by one year in prison or longer) or any crime that involves sexual misconduct (see\n38.2.8.7\n).\nHas been involved in plural marriage (see\n38.2.8.8\n).\nFor guidance about baptizing and confirming individuals who identify as transgender, see\n38.2.8.9\n.\nIf the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president interviews him or her. If he finds the person to be worthy and if he recommends baptism, he submits a request for approval to the First Presidency using\nLCR\n.\nIf the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president both interview him or her. They follow the instructions in\n32.16\n. If they both find the person to be worthy and recommend baptism, the stake president submits a request to the First Presidency using\nLCR\n.\nAny request to the First Presidency should include all pertinent details as determined in the interviews.\nSee\n6.2.3\nabout the stake (or mission) president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency.\nPersons who have been convicted of crimes may not be baptized until they complete their terms of imprisonment. This is true for converts and for those seeking readmission.\nPersons who have been convicted of felonies or any crimes involving sexual misconduct may not be baptized and confirmed until they have also completed their terms of probation or parole. Only the First Presidency may grant an exception (see\n38.2.8.6\n). These persons are encouraged to work closely with local priesthood leaders. They strive to do all they can to receive the Savior’s help to become worthy of baptism and confirmation.\nFull-time missionaries do not teach people who are in prison or jail.\nA person who has been convicted of murder or a crime involving sexual misconduct may not be baptized unless the First Presidency gives approval (see\n38.2.8.6\n). The same is true for a person who has confessed to committing murder even if the confession was in private to a priesthood leader. As used here,\nmurder\ndoes not include abortion or police or military action in the line of duty.\nIf the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president follows the instructions in\n38.2.8.6\n. If the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president follow the instructions in the same section (see also\n32.16\n).\nAn adult who has encouraged, taught, or been involved in plural marriage must receive approval from the First Presidency before he or she may be baptized.\nIf the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president follows the instructions in\n38.2.8.6\n. If the person is a former member seeking readmission, the bishop and stake president follow the instructions in\n38.2.8.6\n(see also\n32.16\n).\nThe request should describe the person’s past involvement in plural marriage. It should also describe his or her repentance and current family situation.\nBaptism and confirmation are received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. Worthy individuals who do not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from their biological sex at birth may be baptized and confirmed. (For a definition of social transition, see\n38.6.23\n.)\nAny exception to this policy requires the approval of the First Presidency. To request approval, the mission president, or the stake president for an eight-year-old, interviews the person. If he finds the person to be worthy and if he recommends baptism and confirmation, he submits a request for approval to the First Presidency using LCR.\nIf the First Presidency approves baptism and confirmation, the person will not be able to receive the priesthood, a temple recommend, or some Church callings while transitioned. However, the individual may participate in the Church in other ways.\nIndividuals who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may be baptized and confirmed.\nMission presidents, or stake presidents for an eight-year-old, address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. They seek counsel from the Area Presidency.\nFor more information, see\n38.6.23\n.\nFor general information about priesthood ordinations, see\n18.10\n.\nWhen a brother is baptized and confirmed, he is eligible to be ordained to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood if he will be at least 12 years old by the end of the year. The bishop interviews him soon after his confirmation, normally within a week. At the same time, he can interview the new member to receive a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations (see\n26.5.1\n). A bishop or branch president may assign one of his counselors to conduct this interview.\nA member of the bishopric presents the brother in sacrament meeting so ward members can sustain his proposed ordination (see\n18.10.3\n). He may then be ordained to the appropriate office:\nDeacon, if he will turn 12 or 13 by the end of the year\nTeacher, if he will turn 14 or 15 by the end of the year\nPriest, if he will turn 16 or older by the end of the year; if he is 19 or older, he is also considered a prospective elder (see\n38.2.9.3\n)\nA new member is eligible to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder when he:\nIs 18 or older.\nHas served as a priest (no specified time is required).\nHas sufficient understanding of the gospel.\nHas demonstrated worthiness.\nNewly baptized brethren are not ordained on the day they are baptized or confirmed. They first need to be interviewed by the bishop and sustained by ward members.\nBaptisms of family members should not be delayed so the father can receive the priesthood and perform the baptisms himself.\nA young man may be ordained to Aaronic Priesthood offices when the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the ordination.\nIf the young man goes by the surname of his stepfather, he may be ordained in that name. This is true even if he has not been formally adopted. However, the young man’s legal name, as defined by local law or custom, should be recorded on the ordination certificate.\nA prospective elder is a male Church member age 19 or older who does not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Married brethren who are younger than 19 and do not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood are also prospective elders.\nUnder the direction of the bishop, the elders quorum presidency works closely with prospective elders to help them prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. If a prospective elder is not a priest, he should be ordained a priest as soon as he is worthy. He does not need to be ordained a deacon or teacher first. He may be ordained an elder when he has developed sufficient understanding of the gospel and demonstrated his worthiness. The bishop and stake president interview him to make this determination (see\n31.2.6\n).\nFor more information about helping prospective elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, see\n8.4\n.\nSometimes a brother who has lived in a ward for less than one year needs or desires to be ordained to a Melchizedek Priesthood office. In that situation, the bishop or an assigned counselor contacts the prior bishop to ask if there are any worthiness matters to be considered. If a counselor learns that there is confidential information, he ends the conversation. He informs his bishop to contact the prior bishop before conducting the interview.\nWorthy men ages 18 and older in young single adult wards and single adult wards should be ordained elders. Those who are not ordained elders are part of the elders quorum as prospective elders.\nA military serviceman is normally interviewed and ordained in the ward that has his membership record. However, this may not be feasible if the serviceman is at sea for an extended time or is serving in a war zone or isolated area. In such cases, the serviceman meets with his service member group leader. If the group leader feels that the serviceman is ready to be ordained, he gives a written recommendation to the presiding leader of the Church unit that oversees the service member group. (If there is not such a Church unit, he gives the recommendation to the Area Presidency.) That leader contacts the bishop of the serviceman’s home ward to certify the man’s worthiness.\nFor ordination to Aaronic Priesthood offices, the presiding leader may authorize the group leader or a Latter-day Saint chaplain to interview the person and oversee the ordination. For ordination to the office of elder, the stake president, mission president, or Area Presidency may authorize a Latter-day Saint chaplain to interview the person and oversee the ordination. All ordinations should be sustained or ratified as explained in\n18.10.3\n.\nA male Church member who has an intellectual disability, his parents (where applicable), and the bishop counsel together about whether he should receive the priesthood. They counsel about his desires and whether he has a basic understanding of the priesthood and his responsibilities.\nPriesthood holders who have such disabilities should be assisted so they can fulfill priesthood duties as fully as possible.\nWhen a man who was not previously endowed is readmitted to the Church by baptism and confirmation, he may be ordained immediately afterward. He is ordained to the priesthood office he held when his membership was withdrawn or resigned.\nIf the man was previously endowed, he is not ordained to a priesthood office. Instead, his previous office is restored through the ordinance of restoration of blessings.\nFor more information and instructions, see\n32.17\n.\nPriesthood ordination is received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. A worthy male Church member who does not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from his biological sex at birth may receive and exercise the priesthood. (For a definition of social transition, see\n38.6.23\n.)\nMale members who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may receive and exercise the priesthood.\nBishops counsel with the stake president to address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. Stake and mission presidents seek counsel from the Area Presidency.\nFor more information, see\n38.6.23\n.\nFor general information about patriarchal blessings, see:\nSection\n18.17\nof this handbook.\nInformation and Suggestions for Patriarchs\n(a resource for stake presidents and patriarchs).\nA member who has an intellectual disability, his or her parents or guardians (where applicable), and the bishop counsel together about whether he or she should receive a patriarchal blessing. They consider the member’s desires and whether he or she has a basic ability to understand the blessing. If so, a member of the bishopric may issue a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in\n18.17\n.\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of spiritual strength for a missionary. If possible, a member should receive a patriarchal blessing before beginning missionary service. When this is not possible, he or she may receive a patriarchal blessing during his or her mission. The mission president interviews the missionary and prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in\n18.17\n.\nA missionary at a missionary training center (MTC) may receive a patriarchal blessing when all of the following apply:\nThe missionary comes from an area where no patriarch is able to give a blessing in the missionary’s native language.\nThe missionary will serve in a mission where no patriarch is able to give a blessing in the missionary’s native language.\nA patriarch near the MTC can provide a blessing in the missionary’s native language.\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of spiritual strength for a member serving in the military. If possible, a worthy member should receive a patriarchal blessing before reporting for active duty.\nIf this is not possible, the member may be able to receive a patriarchal blessing at his or her permanent duty station. A member of the bishopric there interviews the member and prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are in\n18.17\n.\nFor more information, the stake president may contact the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at\nQ12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nA member normally receives a patriarchal blessing from the patriarch in his or her stake. However, a member may receive a blessing from a patriarch in another stake if he or she:\nIs a direct descendant of the patriarch (child, grandchild, or great-grandchild) through birth or adoption.\nLives in a stake that does not have an actively serving patriarch.\nLives in a district.\nDoes not speak the same language as the stake patriarch, and a patriarch in a nearby stake can provide the blessing in the member’s language.\nIn each of these cases, a member of the bishopric or the branch president interviews the member as described in\n18.17\n. A member of the patriarch’s stake presidency and of the recipient’s stake or mission presidency must approve the recommend through the\nPatriarchal Blessing System\n.\nThe inspiration and meaning of a patriarchal blessing is difficult to convey in translation. For this reason, members should receive their blessings in the language they understand best. The Church does not provide written translations of patriarchal blessings.\nMembers are not encouraged to translate patriarchal blessings. However, sometimes a member needs a blessing translated into a language he or she understands. The member may find a trusted and worthy member of the Church who can provide the translation. The member should select a competent translator who understands the spiritual nature and confidentiality of the blessing. Translated copies of blessings are not filed at Church headquarters.\nA stake president may request a braille transcription of a patriarchal blessing. He contacts the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at\nQ12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nIf a member is deaf or hard of hearing, his or her patriarchal blessing can be interpreted in sign language. The member identifies an interpreter. It is best if this person is a trusted and worthy member of the Church who understands the doctrinal significance of patriarchal blessings. However, when a member of the Church cannot be found, another capable person can provide the interpretation.\nIn very rare circumstances, a worthy member may request a replacement patriarchal blessing. However, this is not encouraged, and the request might not be approved. If the member has an important reason for such a request, he or she discusses it with the bishop. If the bishop feels that a replacement blessing is appropriate, he prepares a Patriarchal Blessing Recommend. Instructions are found in\n18.17\n.\nThe stake president then interviews the member and reads the original blessing with him or her. If he feels that a replacement blessing is appropriate, he seeks approval from the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at\nQ12Patriarchs@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe stake president informs the recipient and the patriarch of the decision of the Office of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. If the request is approved, the stake president approves the recommend in the Patriarchal Blessing System. The stake president tells the recipient that the replacement blessing replaces the original blessing. The patriarch may then give a replacement patriarchal blessing.\nChurch leaders encourage members to qualify for temple marriage and be married and sealed in a temple. If allowed by local laws, Church leaders may perform civil marriages in circumstances such as the following:\nA couple plans to be married in a temple, but temple marriages are not legally recognized.\nA couple will be married in a temple, but a civil marriage will help parents or immediate family members feel included.\nAccess to a temple is not available for an extended period of time.\nA couple is not planning to be married in a temple.\nA civil marriage is valid for as long as a couple lives. It does not endure beyond mortal life.\nCivil marriages should be performed in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage is performed.\nCivil marriages and related religious ceremonies should not be performed on the Sabbath. Nor should they be held at unusual hours.\nThe bishop consults with his stake president if he has questions about civil marriage that are not answered in this section. The stake president may direct questions to the Office of the First Presidency.\nWhen permitted by local law, the following currently serving Church officers may act in their calling to perform a civil marriage ceremony:\nMission president\nStake president\nDistrict president\nBishop\nBranch president\nThese officers may only perform a civil marriage between a man and a woman. All of the following conditions must also apply:\nThe bride or the groom is a member of the Church or has a baptismal date.\nEither the bride’s or the groom’s membership record is, or will be after baptism, in the Church unit over which the officer presides.\nThe Church officer is legally authorized to officiate at a civil marriage in the jurisdiction where the marriage will take place.\nLatter-day Saint chaplains on active military duty may perform civil marriages without prior approval.\nChaplains who are assigned to Reserve or National Guard units must receive prior approval from the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division to perform a civil marriage. See contact information in\n38.9.10\n.\nNonmilitary chaplains who serve in the following organizations must receive prior approval from the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division to perform a civil marriage:\nHospitals\nHospice organizations\nAssisted-living centers\nPrisons\nBorder patrol\nPolice or fire departments\nRetired chaplains are not authorized to perform civil marriages in their capacity as chaplains.\nThose who perform marriages acting in their callings as Church leaders or chaplains should use the guidelines in this section. They also follow all legal requirements.\nLatter-day Saint chaplains are not considered presiding Church officers unless they are serving as a stake president, bishop, or branch president. When a chaplain who is not a presiding Church officer performs a civil marriage, he or she functions as an agent of the government or civilian organization he or she serves. Thus, the wording of the civil marriage ceremony is changed slightly for these chaplains as shown in\n38.3.6\n.\nLatter-day Saint chaplains may only perform a civil marriage between a man and a woman.\nChurch officers and chaplains who perform civil marriages for members of the Church should provide the necessary marriage information to the ward or branch clerk. The clerk updates the membership records.\nA Church officer or chaplain who performs civil marriages in a Church capacity may not accept fees.\nA Church officer may not perform a marriage for Church members when neither the bride’s nor the groom’s membership record is in the Church unit over which the officer presides (see\n38.3.1\n). An exception is made for Latter-day Saint chaplains and Church officers who are government officials.\nA Church officer may not perform a marriage when neither the bride nor the groom is a member of the Church unless one or both of them have a baptismal date. An exception is made for Latter-day Saint chaplains and Church officers who are government officials.\nA wedding ceremony may be held in a Church building if it does not disrupt the schedule of regular Church functions. Weddings should not be held on the Sabbath or on Monday evenings. Weddings performed in Church buildings should be simple and dignified. Music should be sacred, reverent, and joyful.\nMarriages may be performed in the chapel, the cultural hall, or another suitable room. Receptions may not be held in the chapel unless it is a multipurpose area. Marriages should follow the guidelines for proper use of the meetinghouse (see\n35.5.3\n).\nThe Church does not allow its meetinghouses or properties to be used for any purpose related to same-sex, polygamous, unlawful, or other marriages not in alignment with Church doctrine or policy.\nIn rare circumstances, the bishop may allow the use of a Church building for marriages that are performed by someone who is not a Church officer or for those who are not Church members. He first counsels with the stake president. He counsels with the person who will be officiating to ensure that he or she understands the guidelines in this section. A member of the stake or ward council attends to ensure proper use and care of the building.\nThe bishop may authorize a livestream of a wedding performed in a Church building (see\n29.7\n).\nIn some locations, laws require that a marriage ceremony be performed by a public official. Some require that the ceremony be performed in a public building or another public place. In these cases, an authorized priesthood officer may conduct a brief religious gathering after the civil marriage. In this gathering he provides counsel to the couple.\nMarriage is sacred and should be honored and dignified as such. Marriages for Church members performed outside the temple should reflect a spirit of commitment and joy.\nExcept where noted, information in this section applies to Latter-day Saint chaplains as well as Church officers.\nBefore performing a civil marriage, a Church officer may counsel the couple on the sacred nature of the marriage vows. He may add other counsel as the Spirit directs.\nTo perform a civil marriage, the Church officer addresses the couple and says, “Please take each other by the right hand.” He then says, “[Groom’s full name] and [bride’s full name], you have taken one another by the right hand in token of the vows you will now enter into in the presence of God and these witnesses.” (The couple may choose or nominate these witnesses ahead of time.)\nThe officer then addresses the groom and asks, “[Groom’s full name], do you receive [bride’s full name] as your lawfully wedded wife, and do you of your own free will and choice solemnly promise as her companion and lawfully wedded husband that you will cleave unto her and none else; that you will observe all the laws, responsibilities, and obligations pertaining to the holy state of matrimony; and that you will love, honor, and cherish her as long as you both shall live?”\nThe groom answers, “Yes” or “I do.”\nThe Church officer then addresses the bride and asks, “[Bride’s full name], do you receive [groom’s full name] as your lawfully wedded husband, and do you of your own free will and choice solemnly promise as his companion and lawfully wedded wife that you will cleave unto him and none else; that you will observe all the laws, responsibilities, and obligations pertaining to the holy state of matrimony; and that you will love, honor, and cherish him as long as you both shall live?”\nThe bride answers, “Yes” or “I do.”\nThe Church officer then addresses the couple and says, “By virtue of the legal authority vested in me as an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I pronounce you, [groom’s name] and [bride’s name], husband and wife, legally and lawfully wedded for the period of your mortal lives.”\n(Alternate wording for a chaplain not serving as a presiding Church officer: “By virtue of the legal authority vested in me as a chaplain in the [branch of military or civilian organization], I pronounce you, [groom’s name] and [bride’s name], husband and wife, legally and lawfully wedded for the period of your mortal lives.”)\n“May God bless your union with joy in your posterity and a long life of happiness together, and may He bless you to keep sacred the vows you have made. These blessings I invoke upon you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.”\nThe invitation to kiss each other as husband and wife is optional, based on cultural norms.\nChurch members make sacred covenants with God as they receive temple ordinances. The temple sealing ordinances unite families for eternity as members strive to honor the covenants they make when they receive the ordinance. Sealing ordinances include:\nSealing of a husband and wife.\nSealing of children to parents.\nThe following table explains where to find policies for sealing of a husband and wife.\nNeed\nSection\nNeed\nI was married civilly and want to be sealed to my spouse.\nSection\n38.4.1.1\nNeed\nI am divorced from a previous spouse and want to be sealed to my current spouse.\nSection\n38.4.1.2\nNeed\nMy spouse to whom I was sealed died. To whom may I now be sealed?\nSection\n38.4.1.3\nNeed\nMay I be sealed to a deceased individual with whom I cohabited without being legally married?\nSection\n38.4.1.4\nNeed\nI need to apply for a sealing cancellation or a sealing clearance.\nSection\n38.4.1.5\nNeed\nI need to have a restriction against temple sealing removed.\nSection\n38.4.1.6\nNeed\nMy spouse and I were married for time only in the temple. Can we be sealed to one another?\nSection\n38.4.1.7\nNeed\nTo whom may my deceased family members be sealed?\nSection\n38.4.1.8\nNeed\nHow does divorce affect my sealing?\nSection\n38.4.1.9\nNeed\nWhat are the effects of canceling a sealing?\nSection\n38.4.1.10\nNeed\nHow does resignation or withdrawal of Church membership affect my sealing?\nSection\n38.4.1.11\nMembers should counsel with their bishop if they have questions about sealing policies that are not answered in this section. The bishop contacts the stake president if he has questions. The stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency if he has questions.\nMembers who have concerns about the eternal nature of the sealing ordinance and their associated family and spousal relationships are encouraged to trust in the Lord and seek His comfort. Heavenly Father will ensure that each person receives every blessing that his or her desires and choices allow.\nA man and woman who were married civilly may be sealed in the temple as soon as circumstances permit if the following conditions are met:\nThey both have been members of the Church for at least one year (see\n27.3.1\nand\n27.2.1\n).\nThey are prepared and worthy.\nWhen issuing temple recommends for a couple to be sealed, priesthood leaders make sure the civil marriage is legally valid. See\n26.3\nand\n27.3\n.\nWomen.\nA living woman may be sealed to only one husband at a time. If she and a husband were sealed and later divorced, she must receive a cancellation of that sealing before being sealed to another man during her lifetime (see\n38.4.1.5\n).\nA living woman who is not currently married or sealed to another man may be sealed to a deceased husband from whom she was divorced in life. She must first receive signed consent from her former husband’s widow (if there is one).\nSee\nchapter 28\nfor information about performing ordinances for a deceased spouse.\nMen.\nIf a man and woman were sealed and later divorced, the man must receive a sealing clearance before being sealed to another woman (see\n38.4.1.5\n). A sealing clearance is necessary even if (1) the previous sealing has been canceled or (2) the previous wife is deceased.\nA sealing clearance is needed only if a man is divorced from the woman who was most recently sealed to him. For example, if a man received a sealing clearance to be sealed to a second wife after a divorce, and then his second wife dies, he would not need another sealing clearance to be sealed again.\nA living man may be sealed to a deceased wife from whom he was divorced in life. He must first receive signed consent from his former wife’s widower (if there is one). If he is married, he also must receive written consent from his current wife if she is living.\nSee\nchapter 28\nfor information about performing ordinances for a deceased spouse.\nWomen.\nIf a husband and wife have been sealed and the husband dies, the woman may not be sealed to another man unless she receives a cancellation of the first sealing (see\n38.4.1.5\n).\nA living woman who is not currently married or sealed to another man may be sealed to a deceased husband (see\n38.4.1.8\n). If the marriage ended in divorce, see\n38.4.1.2\n.\nA living woman who is currently married may not be sealed to a deceased husband without First Presidency approval.\nSee\nchapter 28\nfor information about performing ordinances for a deceased spouse.\nMen.\nIf a husband and wife have been sealed and the wife dies, the man may be sealed to another woman if she is not already sealed to another man. In this circumstance, the man does not need a sealing clearance from the First Presidency unless he was divorced from his previous wife before she died (see\n38.4.1.2\n).\nA living man may be sealed to a deceased wife if she was not sealed to another husband in life. If she was sealed to another husband while living, all men to whom she was married must be deceased before any other man may be sealed to her (see\n38.4.1.8\n). If the marriage ended in divorce, see\n38.4.1.2\n.\nBefore being sealed to a deceased wife, a married man must receive written consent from his current wife if she is living.\nSee\nchapter 28\nfor information about performing ordinances for a deceased spouse.\nWomen.\nAs an exception, a living woman who is not currently married or sealed to another man may be sealed to a deceased man with whom she cohabited. This exception may be considered only if their relationship was of such a nature and duration to show a determination to do all of the following:\nBe faithful to one another in a permanent relationship.\nFulfill all marital responsibilities to each other.\nFulfill all parental responsibilities to any children they had.\nIf the member’s stake president feels that such an exception is warranted, he submits a request to the Office of the First Presidency.\nMen.\nAs an exception, a living man may be sealed to a deceased woman with whom he cohabited if she was not sealed to another man during her life. This exception may be considered only if their relationship was of such a nature and duration to show a determination to do all of the following:\nBe faithful to one another in a permanent relationship.\nFulfill all marital responsibilities to each other.\nFulfill all parental responsibilities to any children they had.\nBefore being sealed to a deceased woman, a married man must receive written consent from his current wife if she is living.\nIf the member’s stake president feels that such an exception is warranted, he submits a request to the Office of the First Presidency.\nSee\n38.4.1.2\nfor information about the sealing of living members after a divorce. See\n38.4.1.3\nfor information about the sealing of living members after a spouse’s death.\nMembers of either gender may seek a sealing cancellation even if they are not preparing to be sealed to another spouse. A male Church member must receive a sealing clearance to be sealed to another woman after a divorce.\nThe process for seeking a sealing cancellation or sealing clearance is outlined below.\nThe member speaks with his or her bishop about the request.\nThe bishop ensures that:\nThe divorce is final.\nThe member is current in all legal requirements for child and spousal support related to the divorce.\nIf the bishop recommends that the sealing cancellation or sealing clearance be granted, he:\nFills out an Application to the First Presidency for the member using\nLeader and Clerk Resources (LCR)\n. Leaders who do not have access to\nLCR\ninstead use a physical copy of the Application to the First Presidency form. This form is available from the Confidential Records Office at Church headquarters.\nSubmits the application to the stake president.\nThe stake president meets with the member. The stake president verifies that:\nThe divorce is final.\nThe member is current in all legal requirements for child and spousal support related to the divorce.\nIf the stake president recommends that the sealing cancellation or sealing clearance be granted, he submits the application to Church headquarters using\nLCR\n. See\n6.2.3\nabout the stake president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency.\nIf the request is approved, the First Presidency provides a letter stating that the sealing cancellation or sealing clearance has been granted.\nAfter approval is granted, the member may schedule an appointment for a temple sealing.\nSee\n38.4.1.9\n.\nA person who commits adultery while married to a spouse to whom he or she has been sealed may not be sealed to the partner in the adultery without approval from the First Presidency.\nA couple may seek approval after they have been married for at least five years. The process for making a request to remove a restriction against temple sealing is outlined below.\nThe couple meets with their bishop and stake president.\nIf these leaders feel that the restriction should be removed, they write letters to the First Presidency with their recommendations. Their letters should describe the applicants’ temple worthiness and the stability of their marriage for at least five years. See\n6.2.3\nabout the stake president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency.\nThe couple also writes a letter of request to the First Presidency.\nThe stake president submits all of these letters to the First Presidency. He may submit the request with an application for a sealing cancellation or sealing clearance (see\n38.4.1.5\n).\nIf the request is approved, the First Presidency provides a letter stating that the restriction against temple sealing has been removed.\nAfter approval is granted, the couple may schedule an appointment to be sealed.\nCouples who were married in a temple for time only are not usually sealed later. For such a sealing to occur, the woman must first receive from the First Presidency a cancellation of her previous sealing. If the bishop and stake president both feel that a cancellation is justified, the stake president submits an application to the First Presidency using\nLCR\n. See\n6.2.3\nabout the stake president’s responsibility when submitting applications to the First Presidency.\nTime-only marriages in the temple are no longer performed (see\n27.3.3\n).\nDeceased Women.\nA deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. The following table shows when these sealings may take place.\nShe was not sealed to a husband in life\nShe may be sealed to all living or deceased men to whom she was married in life. If the man is living, his wife (if he is married) must give written consent (see\n38.4.1.3\n). If the man is deceased, his widow (if any) must give written consent.\nShe was sealed to a husband in life\nAll her husbands must be deceased before she is sealed to other men to whom she was married. This includes former husbands from whom she may have been divorced. Each of the men’s widows (if any) must give written consent.\nDeceased Men.\nA deceased man may be sealed to all women to whom he was legally married during his life if (1) they are deceased or (2) they are living, are not currently married, and are not sealed to another man (see\n38.4.1.3\n).\nBefore a deceased man may be sealed to a deceased woman to whom he was married in life, the woman’s widower (if there is one) must give written consent.\nDeceased Couples Who Were Divorced.\nDeceased couples who were divorced may be sealed by proxy so their children can be sealed to them. See\n28.3.5\nif either the husband or wife had Church membership withdrawn or had resigned membership.\nIf either deceased person has a surviving spouse, that spouse must give written consent.\nFirst Presidency approval is required before sealing a deceased couple who obtained a cancellation of their sealing in life.\nDeceased Couples Who Cohabited but Were Not Married to Each Other.\nA deceased couple may be sealed to each other if they lived together as though they were husband and wife, even if no marriage can be documented. If either deceased person has a surviving spouse, that spouse must give written consent.\nThese sealings are generally done so that a couple’s children can receive the blessing of being sealed to them.\nIf a couple was sealed and later divorced, the blessings of that sealing remain in effect for individuals who are worthy (see\n38.4.1.5\nand\n38.4.1.10\n). A member who remains faithful to temple covenants will receive the personal blessings promised in the temple. This is true even if the person’s spouse has broken the covenants or withdrawn from the marriage.\nSee\n38.4.2.1\nfor information about children who are born after a divorce.\nWhile a sealing remains in place, a member who is faithful to temple covenants will receive the personal blessings promised in the temple. This is true even if the person’s spouse has broken the covenants or withdrawn from the marriage. Moreover, God will not require anyone to remain in a sealed relationship throughout eternity against his or her will. Heavenly Father will ensure that each person receives every blessing that his or her desires and choices allow.\nOnce a sealing cancellation has been granted by the First Presidency, the covenants and blessings related to that sealing are no longer in force. See\n38.4.2.8\nfor information on the status of the couple’s children when a sealing is canceled.\nAny children born to a woman after her sealing to a former husband has been canceled are not born in the covenant unless the mother was sealed to another man before the child’s birth.\nPriesthood leaders counsel with members seeking a cancellation of a sealing to help them understand these principles. Local leaders honor members’ agency in these decisions.\nAfter a couple has been sealed in a temple, if one of them resigns Church membership or has his or her membership withdrawn, his or her temple blessings are also withdrawn. However, the personal blessings of the sealing ordinance for the person’s spouse and children remain in effect if they remain faithful.\nAny children born to a couple after one or both of them have resigned their membership or had their Church membership withdrawn are not born in the covenant. See\n38.4.2.8\n.\nParents must be sealed to each other before children are sealed to them (see\n38.4.1\n).\nMembers should counsel with their bishop if they have questions about sealing policies that are not answered in this section. The bishop contacts the stake president if he has questions. The stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency if he has questions.\nMembers who have concerns about the eternal nature of the sealing ordinance and their associated family relationships are encouraged to trust in the Lord and seek His comfort. Heavenly Father will ensure that each person receives every blessing that his or her desires and choices allow.\nChildren who are born after their mother has been sealed to a husband in a temple are born in the covenant of that sealing. They do not need to receive the ordinance of sealing to parents.\nSometimes a woman who has been sealed to a man later has children with another man. When this occurs, these children are born into the covenant of the woman’s most recent sealing unless they were born (1) after the sealing was canceled or (2) after it was withdrawn due to resignation or withdrawal of Church membership.\nChildren who are not born in the covenant can become part of an eternal family by being sealed to:\nTheir natural parents.\nTheir adoptive parents.\nA natural or adoptive parent and a stepparent (see\n38.4.2.5\n).\nThese children receive the same blessings as if they had been born in the covenant.\nSealing living children to living parents.\nA living child is sealed to only two parents—a husband and wife. If both parents are living, they must be married and sealed to each other.\nSee\n27.4.1\nfor information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents.\nMembers who are 21 or older must be endowed to be sealed to their parents (see\n27.4.1\nand\n27.4.5\n).\nSealing living children to deceased parents.\nA living child is sealed to only one set of parents. The parents must be sealed to each other before children are sealed to them.\nA member who is an adult at the time his or her parents die is generally sealed to those parents. As used here, the term\nparents\nmeans natural parents, adoptive parents, or a natural parent and a stepparent.\nThe following table shows sealing options available to a person whose parents died when he or she was still a minor or who is not accountable due to intellectual disabilities.\nCircumstance\nOptions\nMinor child\nBe sealed to adoptive parents or legal guardians who are raising him or her\nWait until he or she is an adult and then choose to be sealed either (1) to the deceased parents or (2) to the adoptive parents or legal guardians who raised him or her\nPerson who is not accountable due to intellectual disabilities\nBe sealed to adoptive parents or legal guardians who are caring for him or her\nSee\n27.4.1\nfor information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents.\nMembers who are 21 or older must be endowed to be sealed to their parents (see\n27.4.1\nand\n27.4.5\n).\nSealing deceased children to parents (living or deceased).\nA deceased person is usually sealed to his or her birth or adoptive parents. However, a deceased child may also be sealed to:\nA birth mother and stepfather.\nA birth father and stepmother.\nFoster parents or grandparents who raised the child (see\n38.4.2.4\n).\nA couple who intended to adopt the child but could not complete the adoption before the child died (see\n38.4.2.4\n).\nThese sealings may be done even if a deceased child is already sealed to his or her birth or adoptive parents. Sealings to nonbiological or nonadoptive parents in circumstances other than those listed above require First Presidency approval.\nLiving children who are born in the covenant or have been sealed to parents cannot be sealed to any other parents without First Presidency approval.\nLiving children who are legally adopted and were neither born in the covenant nor sealed to former parents may be sealed to their adoptive parents after the adoption is final.\nLiving minor children and adult children who are not accountable due to intellectual disabilities must have a final adoption decree to be sealed to their adoptive parents. The parents present the decree to the bishop when verifying information through Ordinance Preparation in\nLCR\n(see\n27.1.2\n). A court decree granting legal custody is not sufficient. There is no obligation to identify the natural parents of these children.\nLiving adult children who are accountable do not need a formal adoption decree to be sealed to their adoptive parents. Members verify the adoption through Ordinance Preparation in\nLCR\n(see\n27.1.2\n).\nFirst Presidency approval is needed for a living member to be sealed to foster parents. This requirement applies even if the natural parents of the foster child are unknown. Such requests are made by the stake president using\nLCR\n(see\n6.2.3\n).\nA deceased adopted person is usually sealed to his or her adoptive parents.\nA deceased foster child is usually sealed to his or her natural parents.\nMinor children and adult children who are not accountable.\nLiving minor children and adult children who are not accountable due to intellectual disabilities may be sealed to one natural parent and a stepparent only if all the following conditions are met:\nThe child was not born in the covenant or sealed previously.\nThe child has not been adopted by another parent.\nThe other natural parent has given a signed letter of consent for the sealing to take place. A court decree granting legal custody is not sufficient clearance for a sealing. The letter of consent should use wording similar to the following:\n“I, [name of natural parent], give permission for [name of child or children] to be sealed in the temple to [name of parents]. I understand that the sealing is a religious ceremony and does not have legal implications.”\nThis letter is reviewed when verifying information through Ordinance Preparation in\nLCR\nbefore the sealing (see\n27.1.2\n).\nIf the other natural parent is deceased or if his or her parental rights have been fully terminated by legal process, no consent is required. Likewise, no consent is required if the child is considered an adult in the jurisdiction where he or she lives.\nIf the other natural parent cannot be located after thorough efforts to find him or her, no consent is required. In this case, the bishop and stake president certify in the verification process that thorough efforts to locate the missing parent have failed. If the other natural parent comes forward at a later date, the sealing will be subject to review.\nAdult children.\nA living adult member may be sealed to one natural parent and a stepparent if the member was not born in the covenant or previously sealed to parents.\nMembers who are 21 or older must be endowed before being sealed to a natural parent and a stepparent.\nMarried members who are younger than 21 do not need to be endowed to be sealed to a natural parent and a stepparent. However, they must have a current temple recommend to be sealed to parents (see\n27.4.1\nand\n27.4.5\n).\nSee\n27.4.1\nfor information about issuing temple recommends for children being sealed to their parents.\nChildren conceived by artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization are born in the covenant if their parents are already sealed. If the children are born before their parents are sealed, they may be sealed to their parents after their parents are sealed to each other.\nIf a child was born to a surrogate mother, the stake president refers the matter to the Office of the First Presidency (see\n38.6.22\n).\nFaithful children who are born in the covenant or sealed to parents retain the blessings of eternal parentage. This is true even if:\nThe sealing of their parents is later canceled.\nThe Church membership of either parent is later resigned or withdrawn.\nChildren who are born after their parents’ sealing is canceled or withdrawn are not born in the covenant. These children may be sealed to their parents after their parents’ temple blessings are restored (if applicable) and any other obstacles are removed.\nDuring the endowment and sealing ordinances in the temple, Church members wear white clothing.\nWomen wear the following white clothing: a long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve dress (or a skirt and a long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve blouse) and shoes or slippers.\nMen wear the following white clothing: a long-sleeve shirt, necktie or bow tie, pants, socks, and shoes or slippers.\nDuring the endowment and sealing ordinances, members put on additional ceremonial clothing over their white clothing.\nWard and stake leaders encourage endowed members to obtain their own temple clothing. Temple clothing and garments may be purchased from a Church Distribution store or at\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Stake and ward clerks may help members order the clothing.\nThe bishop may use fast-offering funds to help members in need purchase temple clothing and garments (see\nchapter 22\n).\nSome temples have clothing available for rent. If a temple does not have rental clothing, members need to bring temple clothing with them. See\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nto learn whether a particular temple has rental clothing available.\nTemples maintain a limited supply of temple clothing that full-time missionaries may use. There is no rental charge while they are in missionary training centers and when they are authorized to participate in temple ordinances while serving in the mission field. If needed, this clothing may be used by missionaries receiving their own endowment.\nMembers may not make ceremonial temple clothing or temple garments.\nThe garment is available in a variety of fabrics and styles, including for women who are pregnant or nursing (\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nMembers who need garments in a size that is not offered may contact a clothing consultant to place a special order. Contact information is available at\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org/contactus\n.\nFor information about trying on garments before purchasing them, see\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nSpecial-order garments may be purchased for members who are bedridden, have severe physical disabilities, or have allergies to certain fabrics or garments (see “\nObtaining Special-Order Temple Garments and Ceremonial Clothing\n,”\nChurchofJesusChrist.org/tools/help\n).\nMembers who have physical needs or disabilities that require modification to their ceremonial clothing may make a request at\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org/contactus\n. For example, shorter temple robes are available for members who are in wheelchairs or who have other needs.\nTemple ceremonial clothing should not be altered from its authorized design. Members may repair their clothing if doing so does not alter the original design. They may also use a pin or other fastener to secure portions of the clothing as needed.\nFor information about ordering ceremonial clothing for members who have physical needs or disabilities, see\n38.5.3\n.\nThe First Presidency has provided the following guidance on wearing the garment:\n“The garment of the holy priesthood reminds us of the veil in the temple, and that veil is symbolic of Jesus Christ. When you put on your garment, you put on a sacred symbol of Jesus Christ. Wearing it is an outward expression of your inner commitment to follow Him. The garment is also a reminder of your temple covenants. You should wear the garment day and night throughout your life. When it must be removed for activities that cannot reasonably be done while wearing the garment, seek to restore it as soon as possible. As you keep your covenants, including the sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances, you will have greater access to the Savior’s mercy, protection, strength, and power.”\nThe garment should be worn beneath the outer clothing. It is a matter of personal preference whether other undergarments are worn over or under the temple garment.\nMembers should not modify or alter the garment to accommodate different styles of clothing.\nMembers should not inappropriately display the garment to those who do not understand its significance.\nSee\n26.4\n.\nThe garment is a sacred symbol of Jesus Christ. The way we care for our garments should reflect that sacred symbolism.\nMembers may mend tears in the garment as long as the original design is not altered. However, if a mark is completely unraveled or missing, members should replace the garment.\nThe guidelines in this section apply to endowed members who have specific uniform requirements while serving:\nIn the military.\nAs firefighters.\nAs law enforcement officers.\nAs government security agents.\nWhen possible, these members should wear the garment the same as any other member. However, they should avoid inappropriately displaying the garment to the view of those who do not understand its significance. Members should seek the guidance of the Spirit and use tact, discretion, and wisdom. In some cases, it may be best to lay the garment aside temporarily and wear it again when conditions allow. However, mere inconvenience in wearing the garment does not justify laying it aside.\nSometimes service regulations prevent a member from wearing the garment. In these cases, the member’s religious status is not affected. The Lord focuses on the heart and a willing mind (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\n). As long as the member remains worthy, he or she will still receive the blessings associated with wearing the garment. If members are unable to wear the garment, they should wear it again as soon as circumstances allow.\nMembers in these organizations should consult with their individual services on specific requirements that undergarments must meet, such as color or neckline style. These members may send organization-approved apparel that meets garment guidelines to Beehive Clothing to be marked as authorized garments. Guidelines and additional instructions are provided on the\nGarment Guidelines for Military, Law Enforcement, and Firefighters\norder form.\nWhen possible, members with medical conditions should wear the garment the same as any other member.\nSpecial-order garments\nmay be purchased for members who have medical conditions or use medical devices. Members who need special-order garments may contact a clothing consultant to place an order.

Members should seek the guidance of the Spirit in such situations. In some cases, it may be best to lay the garment aside temporarily and wear it again when conditions allow.\nWhen a member cannot wear the garment because of a medical condition or device, his or her religious status is not affected. The Lord focuses on the heart and a willing mind (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\n). As long as the member remains worthy, he or she will receive the blessings associated with wearing the garment.\nTo dispose of worn-out temple garments, members should cut out and destroy the marks. Members then cut up the remaining fabric so it cannot be identified as a garment. The remaining cloth can be discarded.\nTo dispose of worn-out ceremonial temple clothing, members should cut it up so the original use cannot be recognized. The cloth should then be discarded.\nMembers may give garments and temple clothing that are in good condition to other endowed members. Members should not give garments or ceremonial temple clothing to thrift stores, bishops’ storehouses, temples, or charities.\nIf possible, deceased members who are endowed should be buried or cremated in temple clothing. If cultural traditions or burial practices make this inappropriate or difficult, the clothing may be folded and placed next to the body.\nOnly members who were endowed in life may be buried or cremated in temple clothing. An endowed person who stopped wearing the garment before his or her death may be buried or cremated in temple clothing if the family requests.\nA person whose blessings have not been restored after withdrawal or resignation of Church membership may not be buried or cremated in temple clothing.\nA person who was endowed in life and who died by suicide may be buried or cremated in temple clothing.\nTemple clothing that is used for burial or cremation need not be new, but it should be in good condition and clean. The member’s own temple clothing may be used.\nA member who is to be buried or cremated in temple clothing may be dressed by an endowed family member of the same gender or by the spouse. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to dress the body of an endowed man, the bishop may ask the elders quorum president to invite an endowed man to dress the body or to oversee the proper dressing. If a family member is not available or would prefer not to dress the body of an endowed woman, the bishop may ask the Relief Society president to invite an endowed woman to dress the body or to oversee the proper dressing. Leaders ensure that this assignment is given to a person who will not find it objectionable.\nA man’s body is dressed in temple garments and the following white clothing: a long-sleeve shirt, necktie or bow tie, pants, socks, and shoes or slippers. A woman’s body is dressed in temple garments and the following white clothing: a long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve dress (or a skirt and long-sleeve or three-quarter-sleeve blouse), socks or hosiery, and shoes or slippers.\nCeremonial temple clothing is placed on the body as instructed in the endowment. The robe is placed on the right shoulder and tied with the drawstring at the left waistline. The apron is secured around the waist. The sash is placed around the waist and tied in a bow over the left hip. A man’s cap is usually placed beside his body until it is time to close the casket or container. The cap is then placed with the bow over the left ear. A woman’s veil may be draped on the pillow at the back of her head. The veiling of a woman’s face before burial or cremation is optional, as determined by the family.\nIn some areas only a licensed funeral director or an employee of the director is allowed to handle a deceased body. In these cases, an endowed family member or an endowed person who is invited by the bishop or Relief Society president ensures that the clothing is properly placed on the body.\nSome countries require that deceased persons be dressed in biodegradable clothing when they are buried. Biodegradable temple clothing is available at\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nIn areas where temple clothing may be difficult to obtain in time for burial, stake presidents should keep on hand at least two complete sets of medium-sized clothing, one for a man and one for a woman.\nIf temple clothing is not available, a deceased endowed member is clothed for burial in the garment and other suitable clothing.\nA few policies in this section are about matters that the Church “discourages.” Church members usually do not experience membership restrictions because of their decisions about these matters. However, all people are ultimately accountable to God for their decisions.\nHuman life is a sacred gift from God and central to His divine plan for the spiritual progression of His children (see\nMoses 1:39\n;\nAbraham 3:23–26\n). Elective abortion for personal or social convenience is contrary to God’s plan and His commandments. The Lord declared, “Thou shalt not … kill, nor do anything like unto it” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 59:6\n). Members must not submit to, perform, arrange for, pay for, consent to, or encourage an abortion. The only possible exceptions are when:\nPregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\nA competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy.\nA competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.\nAbortion is a most serious matter. Even in these circumstances, members should approach a decision with prayerful deliberation. Members may counsel with their bishops as part of this process. Discussions with members on this subject should always be conducted with love and respect.\nPresiding officers carefully review the circumstances if a Church member has been involved in an abortion. A membership council may be necessary if a member submits to, performs, arranges for, pays for, consents to, or encourages an abortion (see\n32.6.2.5\n). However, a membership council should not be considered if a member was involved in an abortion before baptism. Nor should membership councils or restrictions be considered for members who were involved in an abortion for any of the three reasons outlined earlier in this section.\nA person who seeks forgiveness with “godly sorrow” (\n2 Corinthians 7:10\n; see also\n3 Nephi 9:20\n) and “full purpose of heart” (\n3 Nephi 18:32\n) may repent and be forgiven for the sin of abortion.\nBishops refer questions on specific cases to the stake president. The stake president may direct questions to the Office of the First Presidency if necessary.\nAbuse is the mistreatment or neglect of others in a way that causes physical, sexual, emotional, or financial harm. The Church’s position is that abuse cannot be tolerated in any form. Those who abuse their spouses, children, other family members, or anyone else violate the laws of God and man.\nAll members, especially parents and leaders, are encouraged to be alert and diligent and do all they can to protect children and others against abuse. If members become aware of instances of abuse, they report it to civil authorities and counsel with the bishop. Church leaders should take reports of abuse seriously and never disregard them.\nAll adults who work with children or youth are to complete children and youth protection training within one month of being sustained (see\nProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). They are to repeat the training every three years.\nWhen abuse occurs, the first and immediate responsibility of Church leaders is to help those who have been abused and to protect vulnerable persons from future abuse. Leaders should not encourage a person to remain in a home or situation that is abusive or unsafe.\nIn some countries, the Church has established a confidential abuse help line to assist stake presidents and bishops. These leaders should promptly call the help line about every situation in which a person may have been abused—or is at risk of being abused. They should also call it if they become aware of a member viewing, purchasing, or distributing child pornography.\nThe help line is available for bishops and stake presidents to call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Contact information is provided below.\nUnited States and Canada: 1-801-240-1911 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-1911\nUnited Kingdom: 0800 970 6757\nIreland: 1800 937 546\nCountries in the Europe Central Area: +49 69 54802 016 or\nEURC-Abuse@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nAustralia: 02 9841 5454 (from within the country)\nNew Zealand: 09 488 5592 (from within the country)\nBishops and stake presidents should call the help line when addressing situations involving any type of abuse. Legal and clinical professionals will answer their questions. These professionals will also give instructions about how to:\nAssist victims and help protect them from further abuse.\nHelp protect potential victims.\nComply with legal requirements for reporting abuse.\nThe Church is committed to complying with the law in reporting abuse (see\n38.6.2.7\n). Laws differ by location, and most Church leaders are not legal experts. Calling the help line is essential for bishops and stake presidents to fulfill their responsibilities to report abuse.\nA bishop should also notify his stake president of instances of abuse.\nIn countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of abuse should contact his stake president. The stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office.\nVictims of abuse often suffer serious trauma. Stake presidents and bishops respond with heartfelt compassion and empathy. They provide spiritual counseling and support to help victims overcome the destructive effects of abuse.\nSometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders help them and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see\nAlma 15:8\n;\n3 Nephi 17:9\n).\nStake presidents and bishops should help those who have committed abuse to repent and to cease their abusive behavior. If an adult has committed a sexual sin against a child, the behavior may be very difficult to change. The process of repentance may be very prolonged. See\n38.6.2.3\n.\nStake presidents and bishops should also be caring and sensitive when working with the families of victims and perpetrators of abuse.\nGuidance for counseling victims and offenders is provided at\nAbuse: How to Help\n.\nIn addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims, offenders, and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see\n31.3.6\n.\nFor information about what bishops and stake presidents should do when they learn of any type of abuse, see\n38.6.2.1\n. For information about counseling in cases of sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault, see\n38.6.18.2\n.\nSee also\nFamilyServices.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nAbuse of a child or youth is an especially serious sin (see\nLuke 17:2\n). As used here,\nchild or youth abuse\nincludes the following:\nPhysical abuse:\nInflicting serious bodily harm by physical violence. Some harm may not be visible.\nSexual abuse or exploitation:\nHaving any sexual activity with a child or youth or intentionally allowing or helping others to have such activity. As used here, sexual abuse does not include consensual sexual activity between two minors who are close in age.\nEmotional abuse:\nUsing actions and words to seriously damage a child or youth’s sense of self-respect or self-worth. This usually involves repeated and continuing insults, manipulations, and criticisms that humiliate and belittle. It may also include gross neglect.\nChild pornography:\nSee\n38.6.6\n.\nIf a bishop or stake president learns of or suspects child or youth abuse, he promptly follows the instructions in\n38.6.2.1\n. He also takes action to help protect against further abuse.\nA Church membership council and record annotation are required if an adult member abuses a child or youth as described in this section. See also\n32.6.1.1\nand\n38.6.2.5\n.\nPhysical or emotional bullying between children or youth of a similar age should be addressed by ward leaders. A membership council is not held.\nAbuse of a spouse or another adult can occur in many ways. These include physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse. Adults who are elderly, vulnerable, or disabled are sometimes at high risk for abuse.\nOften there is not a single definition of abuse that can be applied in all situations. Instead, there is a spectrum of severity in abusive behavior. This spectrum ranges from occasionally using sharp words to inflicting serious harm.\nIf a bishop or stake president learns of abuse of a spouse or another adult, he promptly follows the instructions in\n38.6.2.1\n. He also takes action to help protect against further abuse.\nLeaders seek the direction of the Spirit to determine whether personal counseling or a membership council is the most appropriate setting to address abuse. They may also counsel with their direct priesthood leader about the setting. However, any abuse of a spouse or another adult that rises to the levels described below requires holding a membership council.\nPhysical abuse:\nInflicting serious bodily harm by physical violence. Some harm may not be visible.\nSexual abuse:\nSee the situations specified in\n38.6.18.3\n.\nEmotional abuse:\nUsing actions and words to seriously damage a person’s sense of self-respect or self-worth. This usually involves repeated and continuing insults, manipulations, and criticisms that humiliate and belittle.\nFinancial abuse:\nTaking advantage of someone financially. This may include the illegal or unauthorized use of a person’s property, money, or other valuables. It may also include fraudulently obtaining financial power over someone. It could include using financial power to coerce behavior. See also\n32.6.1.3\n.\nMembers who have abused others should not be given Church callings and may not have a temple recommend until they have repented and Church membership restrictions have been removed.\nIf a person abused a child or youth sexually or seriously abused a child or youth physically or emotionally, his or her membership record will be annotated. He or she must not be given any calling or assignment involving children or youth. This includes not being given a ministering assignment to a family with youth or children in the home. It also includes not having a youth as a ministering companion. These restrictions should remain in place unless the First Presidency authorizes removal of the annotation. See\n32.14.5\nfor information about annotations.\nIn stake and ward council meetings, stake presidencies and bishoprics regularly review Church policies and guidelines on preventing and responding to abuse. They teach the key messages in the\nAbuse\nsection of Life Help in the Gospel Library. They invite discussion from council members. Leaders and council members seek the guidance of the Spirit as they teach and discuss this sensitive subject.\nCouncil members are also to complete children and youth protection training (see\n38.6.2\n).\nIf a member’s abusive activities have violated applicable law, the bishop or stake president should urge the member to report these activities to law enforcement personnel or other appropriate government authorities. The bishop or stake president can obtain information about local reporting requirements through the Church’s help line (see\n38.6.2.1\n). If members have questions about reporting requirements, he encourages them to secure qualified legal advice.\nChurch leaders and members should fulfill all legal obligations to report abuse to civil authorities. In some locations, leaders and teachers who work with children and youth are considered “mandated reporters” and must report abuse to legal authorities. Similarly, in many locations, any person who learns of abuse is required to report it to legal authorities. Bishops and stake presidents should call the help line for details about mandated reporters and other legal requirements for reporting abuse. The Church’s policy is to obey the law.\nSee\n38.6.9\n.\nPhysical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife (see\n2.1.2\n).\nIt is the privilege of married couples who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for the spirit children of God, whom they are then responsible to nurture and rear (see\n2.1.3\n). The decision about how many children to have and when to have them is extremely personal and private. It should be left between the couple and the Lord. Church members should not judge one another in this matter.\nThe Church discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control. Surgical sterilization includes procedures such as vasectomies and tubal ligations. However, this decision is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of the husband and wife. Couples should counsel together in unity and seek the confirmation of the Spirit in making this decision.\nSurgical sterilization is sometimes needed for medical reasons. Members may benefit from counseling with medical professionals.\nThe Lord’s law of chastity is:\nAbstinence from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman.\nFidelity within marriage.\nPhysical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife.\nOnly a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife should have sexual relations. In God’s sight, moral cleanliness is very important. Violations of the law of chastity are very serious (see\nExodus 20:14\n;\nMatthew 5:28\n;\nAlma 39:5\n). Those involved misuse the sacred power God has given to create life.\nA Church membership council may be necessary if a member:\nHas sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, such as adultery, fornication, same-sex relations, and sexual encounters online or over the phone (see\n32.6.2\n).\nIs in a form of marriage or partnership that is outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, such as cohabitation, civil unions and partnerships, and same-sex marriage.\nUses pornography intensively or compulsively, causing significant harm to a member’s marriage or family (see\n38.6.13\n).\nThe decision about whether to hold a membership council in these situations depends on many circumstances (see\n32.7\n). For example, a council is more likely to be necessary to help a member repent if he or she has violated temple covenants or if the sin was repetitive.\nSee\n32.6.1.2\nfor when a council is\nrequired\nfor sexual sins.\nIn some cases, personal counseling and informal membership restrictions may be sufficient (see\n32.8\n).\nThe Church condemns child pornography in any form. If a bishop or stake president learns that a member is involved with child pornography, he promptly follows the instructions in\n38.6.2.1\n.\nA Church membership council and record annotation are required if a member makes, shares, possesses, or repeatedly views pornographic images of children (see\n32.6.1.2\nand\n32.14.5\n). This guideline generally does not apply to children or youth of approximately the same age who share sexual pictures of themselves or others. Personal counseling and informal membership restrictions may be appropriate in those situations.\nFor more guidance, see\n38.6.13\n.\nThe pattern of a husband and wife providing bodies for God’s spirit children is divinely appointed (see\n2.1.3\n). For this reason, the Church discourages donating sperm or eggs. However, this is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of the potential donor. See\n38.6.9\n. The Church also discourages selling sperm or eggs.\nThe Church condemns female genital mutilation.\nThe pattern of a husband and wife providing bodies for God’s spirit children is divinely appointed (see\n2.1.3\n). When needed, reproductive technology can assist a married woman and man in their righteous desire to have children. This technology includes artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization.\nThe Church discourages artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization using sperm from anyone but the husband or an egg from anyone but the wife. However, this is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of a lawfully married man and woman.\nFor information about the sealing of children who are conceived by artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, see\n38.4.2.6\n.\nSee also “\nAdoption\n” (Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nThe Church condemns any form of incest. As used here,\nincest\nis sexual relations between:\nA parent and a child.\nA grandparent and a grandchild.\nSiblings.\nAn uncle or aunt and a niece or nephew.\nAs used here,\nchild, grandchild, siblings, niece,\nand\nnephew\ninclude biological, adopted, step, or foster relationships. Incest can occur between two minors, an adult and a minor, or two adults. If a stake president has questions about whether a relationship is incestuous under local laws, he seeks guidance from the Office of the First Presidency.\nWhen a minor is a victim of incest, the bishop or stake president calls the Church’s abuse help line in countries where it is available (see\n38.6.2.1\n). In other countries, the stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office.\nA Church membership council and record annotation are required if a member commits incest (see\n32.6.1.2\nand\n32.14.5\n). Incest almost always requires the Church to withdraw a person’s membership.\nIf a minor commits incest, the stake president contacts the Office of the First Presidency for direction.\nVictims of incest often suffer serious trauma. Leaders respond with heartfelt compassion and empathy. They provide spiritual support and counseling to help them overcome the destructive effects of incest.\nSometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders help them and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see\nAlma 15:8\n;\n3 Nephi 17:9\n).\nIn addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see\n38.6.18.2.\nSee\n38.6.9\n.\n“That which is of God is light” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:24\n). The occult focuses on darkness and leads to deception. It destroys faith in Christ.\nThe occult includes Satan worship. It also includes mystical activities that are not in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Such activities include (but are not limited to) fortune-telling, curses, and healing practices that are imitations of the priesthood power of God (see\nMoroni 7:11–17\n).\nChurch members should not engage in any form of Satan worship or participate in any way with the occult. They should not focus on such darkness in conversations or in Church meetings.\nThe Church condemns pornography in any form. Pornography use of any kind damages individual lives, families, and society. It also drives away the Spirit of the Lord. Church members should avoid all forms of pornographic material and oppose its production, dissemination, and use.\nThe Church provides the following resources to help people whose lives are affected by pornography:\nAddressingPornography.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nAddictionRecovery.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nHelping Those Who Struggle with Pornography\n(booklet)\nLet Virtue Garnish Thy Thoughts\n(booklet)\nStake presidents and bishops also provide support to family members as needed.\nSome exposure to pornography may be inadvertent. Intentional use of pornography is harmful—whether occasional or intensive.\nPersonal counseling and informal membership restrictions are usually sufficient when helping a person repent of using pornography (see\n32.8\n). Membership councils are not usually held. However, a council may be necessary for intensive and compulsive use of pornography that has caused significant harm to a member’s marriage or family (see\n38.6.5\n). A council is required if a member makes, shares, possesses, or repeatedly views pornographic images of children (see\n38.6.6\n).\nIn addition to the inspired help of Church leaders, some members may need professional counseling. Leaders may contact Family Services for assistance if needed. See\n31.3.6\nfor contact information.\nAll people are children of God. All are brothers and sisters who are part of His divine family (see “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n”). God “hath made of one blood all nations” (\nActs 17:26\n). “All are alike” unto Him (\n2 Nephi 26:33\n). Each person is “as precious in his sight as the other” (\nJacob 2:21\n).\nPrejudice is not consistent with the revealed word of God. Favor or disfavor with God depends on devotion to Him and His commandments, not on the color of a person’s skin or other attributes.\nThe Church calls on all people to abandon attitudes and actions of prejudice toward any group or individual. Members of the Church should lead out in promoting respect for all of God’s children. Members follow the Savior’s commandment to love others (see\nMatthew 22:35–39\n). They strive to be persons of goodwill toward all, rejecting prejudice of any kind. This includes prejudice based on race, ethnicity, nationality, tribe, gender, age, disability, socioeconomic status, religious belief or nonbelief, and sexual orientation.\nThe Church encourages families and members to reach out with sensitivity, love, and respect to persons who are attracted to others of the same sex. The Church also promotes understanding in society at large that reflects its teachings about kindness, inclusiveness, love for others, and respect for all human beings. The Church does not take a position on the causes of same-sex attraction.\nGod’s commandments forbid all unchaste behavior, either heterosexual or same-sex. Church leaders counsel members who have violated the law of chastity. Leaders help them have a clear understanding of faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, the process of repentance, and the purpose of life on earth. Behavior that is inconsistent with the law of chastity may be cause for holding a Church membership council (see\n38.6.5\n). It can be forgiven through sincere repentance.\nFeeling same-sex attraction is not a sin. Members who have these feelings and do not pursue or act on them are living in accordance with Heavenly Father’s plan for His children and with Church doctrine. Leaders support and encourage them in their resolve to live according to the commandments of the Lord. Members with these feelings may receive Church callings, have temple recommends, and receive temple ordinances if they are worthy. Male Church members may receive and exercise the priesthood.\nAll members who keep their covenants will receive all promised blessings in the eternities whether or not their circumstances allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life (see\nMosiah 2:41\n).\nThe Church provides the following resources to better understand and support people whose lives are affected by same-sex attraction:\n“\nSame-Sex Attraction\n,” Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n“\nSame-Sex Attraction\n,” Life Help,\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\nIn addition to the inspired help of Church leaders, members may benefit from professional counseling. Leaders may contact Family Services for assistance. See\n31.3.6\nfor contact information.\nAs a doctrinal principle, based on the scriptures, the Church affirms that marriage between a man and a woman is essential to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children. The Church also affirms that God’s law defines marriage as the legal and lawful union between a man and a woman.\nOnly a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife should have sexual relations. Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same sex, are sinful and undermine the divinely created institution of the family.\nParents have primary responsibility for the sex education of their children. Parents should have honest, clear, and ongoing conversations with their children about healthy, righteous sexuality. These conversations should:\nBe appropriate to the age and maturity of the child.\nHelp children prepare for happiness in marriage and follow the law of chastity (see\n2.1.2\n).\nAddress the dangers of pornography, the need to avoid it, and how to respond when they encounter it.\nFor more information, see “\nSex Education and Behavior\n” (Topics and Questions,\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nAs part of their responsibility to teach their children, parents should be aware of and appropriately seek to influence the sex education taught at school. Parents teach correct principles and support school instruction that is consistent with the gospel.\nThe Church condemns sexual abuse. As used here,\nsexual abuse\nis defined as imposing any unwanted sexual activity on another person. Sexual activity with a person who does not or cannot give legal consent is considered sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can also occur with a spouse or in a dating relationship. For information about sexual abuse of a child or youth, see\n38.6.2.3\n.\nSexual abuse covers a broad range of actions, from harassment to rape and other forms of sexual assault. It can occur physically, verbally, and in other ways. For guidance about counseling members who have experienced sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault, see\n38.6.18.2\n.\nIf members suspect or become aware of sexual abuse, they take action to protect victims and others as soon as possible. This includes reporting to civil authorities and alerting the bishop or stake president. If a child has been abused, members should follow the instructions in\n38.6.2\n.\nIf a bishop or stake president learns of sexual abuse, rape, or another form of sexual assault, he calls the Church’s abuse help line in countries where it is available (see\n38.6.2.1\nfor contact information). Legal and clinical professionals will answer his questions. These professionals will also give instructions about how to:\nAssist victims and help protect them from further harm.\nHelp protect potential victims.\nComply with legal requirements for reporting.\nIn countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of these offenses should contact his stake president. The stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office.\nVictims of sexual abuse, rape, or other forms of sexual assault often suffer serious trauma. When they confide in a bishop or stake president, he responds with heartfelt compassion and empathy. He provides spiritual counseling and support to help victims overcome the destructive effects of abuse. He also calls the Church’s abuse help line for guidance where it is available (see\n38.6.18.1\n).\nSometimes victims have feelings of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders do not blame the victim. They help victims and their families understand God’s love and the healing that comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see\nAlma 15:8\n;\n3 Nephi 17:9\n).\nWhile members may choose to share information about the abuse or assault, leaders should not focus excessively on the details. This can be harmful to victims.\nIn addition to receiving the inspired help of Church leaders, victims and their families may need professional counseling. For information, see\n31.3.6\n.\nA membership council may be necessary for a person who has sexually assaulted or abused someone. A membership council is required if a member committed rape or is convicted of another form of sexual assault (see\n32.6.1.1\n).\nA council must also be held for sexual activity with a vulnerable adult. As used here, a\nvulnerable adult\nis a person who, because of physical or mental limitations, either cannot consent to the activity or cannot understand the nature of it.\nTo address other forms of sexual abuse, leaders seek the Spirit’s guidance about whether personal counseling or a membership council is the most appropriate setting (see\n32.6.2.2\nand\n32.8\n). In severe cases a council is required. Leaders may counsel with their direct priesthood leader about the setting.\nIf membership restrictions result from a membership council that is held for a perpetrator of sexual abuse, that person’s membership record is annotated.\nFor information about counseling in cases of abuse, see\n38.6.2.2\n. For information about counseling victims of sexual assault, see\n38.6.18.2\n.\nChurch members who are single and pregnant are encouraged to meet with their bishop. In the United States and Canada, Family Services is available for:\nConsultation with Church leaders.\nCounseling with single expectant parents and their families.\nNo bishop’s referral is needed for this service. There is no charge. See\n31.3.6\nfor Family Services contact information.\nIn other areas, leaders may contact Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager in the area office for consultation.\nGuidance for counseling single expectant parents is also provided at “\nUnwed Pregnancy\n” (Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nMortal life is a precious gift from God—a gift that should be valued and protected. The Church strongly supports the prevention of suicide. For information about how to help someone who is suicidal or someone who has been affected by suicide, see\nsuicide.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nMost people who have thought about suicide want to find relief from physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual pain. Such individuals need love, help, and support from family, Church leaders, and qualified professionals.\nThe bishop provides ecclesiastical support if a member is considering suicide or has attempted it. He also immediately helps the member obtain professional help. He encourages those close to the person to seek professional help as needed.\nDespite the best efforts of loved ones, leaders, and professionals, suicide is not always preventable. It leaves behind deep heartbreak, emotional upheaval, and unanswered questions for loved ones and others. Leaders should counsel and console the family. They provide nurturing and support. The family may also need professional support and counseling.\nIt is not right for a person to take his or her own life. However, only God is able to judge the person’s thoughts, actions, and level of accountability (see\n1 Samuel 16:7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 137:9\n).\nThe family, in consultation with the bishop, determines the place and nature of a funeral service for the person. The family may choose to use Church facilities. If the person was endowed in life, he or she may be buried or cremated in temple clothing.\nThose who have lost a loved one to suicide can find hope and healing in Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nFor information about suicide prevention and ministering, see\nsuicide.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nSee\n38.6.4\n.\nThe pattern of a husband and wife providing bodies for God’s spirit children is divinely appointed (see\n2.1.3\n). For this reason, the Church discourages surrogate motherhood. However, this is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the judgment and prayerful consideration of the husband and wife.\nChildren who are born to a surrogate mother are not born in the covenant. Following their birth, they may be sealed to parents only with the approval of the First Presidency (see\n38.4.2.7\n). The parents write a letter to the First Presidency and give it to the stake president. If he supports the request, he submits the letter along with his own letter.\nGender is an essential characteristic in Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness (see\nGenesis 1:27\n). The intended meaning of\ngender\nin “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” is biological sex at birth. (For those whose biological sex is not clear at birth, see\n38.7.7\n.)\nSome people feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth. The Church does not take a position on the causes of these feelings. Some who experience these feelings identify as transgender.\nThese individuals often face complex challenges. They—and their family and friends—should be treated with sensitivity, kindness, compassion, and Christlike love. All are children of God and have divine worth.\nThe ordinances of salvation and exaltation are received according to a person’s biological sex at birth. For guidance about administering these ordinances, refer to the following:\nBaptism and confirmation (see\n38.2.8.9\n)\nPriesthood ordination (see\n38.2.9.9\n)\nTemple ordinances (see\n26.5.6\n)\nWorthy individuals who do not pursue surgical, medical, or social transition away from their biological sex at birth may enjoy all the privileges of Church membership.\nChurch leaders counsel against pursuing surgical, medical, or social transition away from one’s biological sex at birth. (Social transitioning means intentionally identifying and presenting oneself as other than one’s biological sex at birth, and may include changing dress, grooming, names, or pronouns.) Leaders advise that taking these actions will result in some Church membership restrictions. These restrictions include receiving or exercising the priesthood, receiving or using a temple recommend, and serving in some Church callings.\nIndividuals who transition away from their biological sex at birth are welcome to attend sacrament meetings and participate in the Church in many other ways. These individuals and their families are encouraged to counsel with their local leaders regarding Church participation. Church leaders teach gospel truth and minister in a Christlike way. They consider the needs of all involved. Sections of this handbook—such as attendance at Church meetings and activities (see\n38.1.1\n), participation in family history work (see\n25.1\nand\n25.4\n), service to others (see\n22.2.3\n), and so on—should guide leaders as they counsel with individuals and their families. For further guidance on Church participation of individuals who identify as transgender, refer to these\nguiding principles\n.\nMembers who have taken steps to transition and then transition back to their biological sex at birth and are worthy and committed to keeping God’s commandments may enjoy all the privileges of Church membership.\nCircumstances vary greatly from person to person and can change over time. Members who feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth or who identify as transgender, as well as the parents or guardians of minors facing such circumstances, are encouraged to seek counsel from their bishop. Bishops counsel with the stake president to address individual circumstances with sensitivity and Christlike love. Stake and mission presidents seek counsel from the Area Presidency.\nNational and local laws vary regarding individuals who identify as transgender. In the United States and Canada, stake presidents and mission presidents who have questions about legal requirements should contact the Church’s Office of General Counsel:\n1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301\n1-801-240-6301\nOutside the United States and Canada, these leaders should contact the area legal counsel at the area office.\nFor more information about understanding and supporting individuals who feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth or who identify as transgender, see “\nTransgender\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nAn autopsy may be performed if the family of the deceased person gives consent and if the autopsy complies with the law. In some cases, an autopsy is required by law.\nThe family of the deceased person decides whether his or her body should be buried or cremated. They respect the desires of the individual.\nIn some countries, the law requires cremation. In other cases, burial is not practical or affordable for the family. In all cases, the body should be treated with respect and reverence. Members should be reassured that the power of the Resurrection always applies (see\nAlma 11:42–45\n).\nWhere possible, the body of a deceased member who has been endowed should be dressed in ceremonial temple clothing when it is buried or cremated (see\n38.5.10\n).\nA funeral or memorial service provides an opportunity for families to gather and perpetuate family relations and values (see\n29.5.4\n).\nParents who experience the death of an unborn child suffer grief and loss. Leaders, family members, and ministering brothers and sisters offer emotional and spiritual support.\nParents may decide whether to hold memorial or graveside services.\nParents may record information about the child in\nFamilySearch.org\n. Instructions are provided on the website.\nTemple ordinances are not needed or performed for children who die before birth. This does not deny the possibility that these children may be part of the family in the eternities. Parents are encouraged to trust the Lord and seek His comfort.\nMortal life is a precious gift from God. Euthanasia is deliberately ending the life of a person who is suffering from an incurable disease or other condition. A person who participates in euthanasia, including assisting someone to die by suicide, violates the commandments of God and may violate local laws.\nDiscontinuing or forgoing extreme life support measures for a person at the end of life is not considered euthanasia (see\n38.7.11\n).\nMembers who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or who have AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) should be welcomed at Church meetings and activities. Their attendance is not a health risk to others.\nFor some people, hypnosis can compromise agency. Members are discouraged from participating in hypnosis for purposes of demonstration or entertainment.\nThe use of hypnosis for treating diseases or mental disorders should be determined in consultation with competent medical professionals.\nIn extremely rare circumstances, a baby is born with genitals that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia, sexual ambiguity, or intersex). Parents or others may have to make decisions to determine their child’s sex with the guidance of competent medical professionals. Decisions about proceeding with medical or surgical intervention are often made in the newborn period. However, they can be delayed unless they are medically necessary.\nSpecial compassion and wisdom are required when youth or adults who were born with sexual ambiguity experience emotional conflict regarding the gender decisions made in infancy or childhood and the gender with which they identify.\nQuestions about membership records, priesthood ordination, and temple ordinances for youth or adults who were born with sexual ambiguity should be directed to the Office of the First Presidency.\nSeeking competent medical help, exercising faith, and receiving priesthood blessings work together for healing, according to the will of the Lord.\nMembers should not use or promote medical or health practices that are ethically, spiritually, or legally questionable. Those who have health problems should consult with competent medical professionals who are licensed in the areas where they practice.\nIn addition to seeking competent medical help, members of the Church are encouraged to follow the scriptural injunction in\nJames 5:14\nto “call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.” Priesthood blessings of healing are given by those who hold the necessary priesthood office. They are given when requested and at no charge (see\n18.13\n).\nChurch members are discouraged from seeking miraculous or supernatural healing from an individual or group that claims to have special methods for accessing healing power outside of prayer and properly performed priesthood blessings. These practices are often referred to as “energy healing.” Other names are also used. Such promises for healing are often given in exchange for money.\nThe Church opposes the use of marijuana for non-medical purposes. See\n38.7.14\n.\nHowever, marijuana may be used for medicinal purposes when the following conditions are met:\nThe use is determined to be medically necessary by a licensed physician or another legally approved medical provider.\nThe person follows the dosage and mode of administration from the physician or other authorized medical provider. The Church does not approve of vaping marijuana unless the medical provider has authorized it based on medical necessity.\nThe Church does not approve of smoking marijuana, including for medical purposes.\nThe donation of organs and tissues is a selfless act that often results in great benefit to individuals with medical conditions.\nThe decision of a living person to donate an organ to another or to receive a donated organ should be made with competent medical counsel and prayerful consideration.\nThe decision to authorize the transplant of organs or tissue from a deceased person is made by the person or by his or her family.\nWhen facing severe illness, members should exercise faith in the Lord and seek competent medical assistance. However, when dying becomes inevitable, it should be seen as a blessing and a purposeful part of eternal existence (see\n2 Nephi 9:6\n;\nAlma 42:8\n).\nMembers should not feel obligated to extend mortal life by extreme means. These decisions are best made by the person, if possible, or by family members. They should seek competent medical advice and divine guidance through prayer.\nLeaders offer support to those who are deciding whether or not to remove life support for a family member.\nMany private groups and commercial organizations have programs that claim to improve self-awareness, self-esteem, spirituality, or family relationships. These groups tend to promise quick solutions to problems that normally require time, prayer, and personal effort to resolve. Although participants may experience temporary relief or exhilaration, previous problems often return, leading to added disappointment and despair.\nSome of these groups claim or imply that the Church or individual General Authorities have endorsed them. However, these claims are not true.\nChurch members are warned that some of these groups advocate concepts and use methods that can be harmful. Many groups also charge exorbitant fees and encourage long-term commitments. Some combine worldly concepts with gospel principles in ways that can undermine spirituality and faith.\nChurch leaders are not to pay for, promote, or endorse such groups or practices. Church facilities may not be used for these activities.\nMembers who have social or emotional concerns may consult with leaders for guidance in identifying sources of help that are in harmony with gospel principles. For more information, see\n22.3.4\n.\nVaccinations administered by competent medical professionals protect health and preserve life. Members of the Church are encouraged to safeguard themselves, their children, and their communities through vaccination.\nUltimately, individuals are responsible to make their own decisions about vaccination. If members have concerns, they should counsel with competent medical professionals and also seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost.\nProspective missionaries who have not been vaccinated will likely be limited to assignments in their home country.\nThe Word of Wisdom is a commandment of God. He revealed it for the physical and spiritual benefit of His children. Prophets have clarified that the teachings in\nDoctrine and Covenants 89\ninclude abstinence from tobacco, strong drinks (alcohol), and hot drinks (tea and coffee).\nProphets have also taught members to avoid substances that are harmful, illegal, or addictive or that impair judgment.\nThere are other harmful substances and practices that are not specified in the Word of Wisdom or by Church leaders. Members should use wisdom and prayerful judgment in making choices to promote their physical, spiritual, and emotional health.\nThe Apostle Paul stated: “Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s” (\n1 Corinthians 6:19–20\n).\nThe Lord promises spiritual and temporal blessings to those who obey the Word of Wisdom and the guidance of living prophets (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:18–21\n).\nAdopting children and providing foster care can bless children and families. Loving, eternal families can be created through adoption. Whether children come to a family through adoption or birth, they are an equally precious blessing.\nMembers who seek to adopt or provide foster care to children should obey all applicable laws of the countries and governments involved.\nThe Church does not facilitate adoptions. However, in the United States and Canada, leaders can refer members to Family Services as a consultation resource. For contact information, see\n31.3.6\n.\nFor information about single expectant parents, see\n38.6.19\n.\nFor more information, see “\nAdoption\n” (Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nAffinity fraud occurs when a person exploits another’s trust or confidence to defraud him or her. This can happen when both people belong to the same group, such as the Church. It can also happen by abusing a position of friendship or trust, such as a Church calling or family relationship. Affinity fraud is usually for financial gain.\nChurch members should be honest in their dealings and act with integrity. Affinity fraud is a shameful betrayal of trust and confidence. Its perpetrators may be subject to criminal prosecution. Church members who commit affinity fraud may also face membership restrictions or withdrawal. See\n32.6.1.3\nand\n32.6.2.3\nfor guidance about membership councils for fraudulent acts.\nMembers may not state or imply that their business dealings are sponsored by, endorsed by, or represent the Church or its leaders.\nAudiovisual materials can help invite the Spirit and enhance gospel teaching in Church classes and meetings. Examples of these materials include videos, pictures, and music recordings. Use of these materials should never become a distraction or the main focus of the class or meeting.\nMembers should not use audiovisual materials in sacrament meetings or in the general session of stake conference. However, recorded music may be used in these meetings if needed to accompany hymns.\nMembers should obey all copyright laws when using audiovisual materials (see\n38.8.11\n). They should only use materials that are in harmony with the gospel and help invite the Spirit.\nChurch members should not seek the autographs of General Authorities, General Officers, or Area Seventies. Nor should members ask these leaders to sign their scriptures, hymnals, or programs. Doing so detracts from their sacred callings and the spirit of meetings. It also could prevent them from greeting other members.\nMembers should not take photographs of General Authorities, General Officers, or Area Seventies in chapels during meetings (see\n29.8\n).\nChurch meetinghouses and other facilities, Church meetings and classes, and Church websites and social media channels may not be used to promote any business or non-Church entity.\nLists of Church groups or other information about members may not be given to any business or non-Church entity. These include (but are not limited to) those that promote dating, education, and job opportunities. See\n38.8.31\n.\nChurch employees are to live and uphold Church standards at all times. They must also comply with local employment laws.\nTo begin or continue Church employment, members must be worthy of a temple recommend. Periodically, representatives of the Church Human Resource Department will contact stake presidents or bishops to verify the temple worthiness of current or potential Church employees. Leaders should respond promptly.\nThe Church magazines include:\nThe\nFriend\nfor children.\nFor the Strength of Youth\nfor youth.\nThe\nLiahona\nfor adults.\nThe First Presidency encourages all members to read the Church magazines. The magazines can help members learn the gospel of Jesus Christ, study the teachings of living prophets, feel connected to the global Church family, face challenges with faith, and draw closer to God.\nLeaders help members access the magazines at no cost as follows:\nHelp members subscribe to the magazines and renew their subscriptions at\nMagazineSubscriptions.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nor by subscribing for them using Leader and Clerk Resources.\nShow members how to access magazine content on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, the Gospel Library app, and the Gospel Living app. This digital content is free.\nSoon after new members are baptized, show them how to access Church magazines digitally or in print.\nProvide ongoing subscriptions to all children and youth who attend church without a parent or guardian, using Leader and Clerk Resources.\nBishops may call a magazine representative to help members access the magazines. Or they may assign the ward executive secretary to assist (see\n7.3\n).\nThe magazine representative or executive secretary can also help gather faith-promoting experiences and testimonies from local members to share with the magazines.\nMembers can manage subscriptions at\nMagazineSubscriptions.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, using their Church account. For help, members may contact the ward clerk or magazine representative.\nThe Church’s name, wordmark, and symbol are key Church identifiers. They are registered as trademarks or are otherwise legally protected worldwide. They are used to identify official literature, news, and events of the Church.\nThe Church’s key identifiers are to be used only according to the guidelines provided below.\nWritten name of the Church.\nLocal units may use the written name of the Church (not the wordmark or symbol) when all of the following conditions are met:\nThe activity or function with which the name is associated is officially sponsored by the unit (for example, a sacrament meeting program).\nThe name of the local unit is used as a prelude to the name of the Church (for example, Campo Rosa Branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).\nThe typeface does not imitate or resemble the official Church wordmark.\nWordmark and symbol.\nThe Church’s wordmark and symbol (see the illustration above) are to be used only as approved by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They may not be used as decorative elements. Nor may they be used in any personal, commercial, or promotional way.\nQuestions should be directed to:\nIntellectual Property Office\n50 East North Temple Street\nSalt Lake City, UT 84150-0005\nTelephone: 1-801-240-3959 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-3959\nFax: 1-801-240-1187\nEmail:\ncor-intellectualproperty@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nWhen Church employees and volunteers need to contact a stake president or bishop, they direct the communication to the leader’s executive secretary unless the matter is very urgent or confidential. This allows stake presidents and bishops to focus on the many responsibilities that only they can fulfill.\nChurch employees and volunteers include representatives of all Church departments, education programs and schools, welfare and self-reliance operations, and Church-affiliated businesses.\nWhen an executive secretary is not called or fully functioning, a leader may be contacted directly.\nComputers and software used in Church meetinghouses are provided and managed by Church headquarters or the area office. Leaders and members use these resources to support Church purposes, including family history work.\nAll software on these computers must be properly licensed to the Church.\nThe stake president oversees the placement and use of computers in the stake, including those in FamilySearch centers. The stake technology specialist ensures that they are properly updated and maintained as outlined in\n33.10\n.\nCopyright is protection given by law to the creators of original works of authorship that are expressed in a tangible (including digital) form, including:\nLiterary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works.\nWorks of art, photography, and sculpture.\nAudio and audiovisual works (such as movies and videos, CDs, and DVDs).\nComputer programs or games.\nInternet and other databases.\nThe laws governing creative works and their permissible use vary by country. The Church policies outlined in this section are consistent with international treaties that apply in most countries. For simplicity, this section refers to a creator’s rights as “copyright.” However, certain of these rights may be known by different names in some countries.\nChurch members should strictly observe all copyright laws. Generally, only copyright owners may authorize the following uses of their work:\nDuplication (copying)\nDistribution\nPublic performance\nPublic display\nCreation of derivatives\nUsing a work in any of these ways without authorization from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy. Such use may also subject the Church or the user to legal liability.\nA user of a work should assume that it is protected by copyright. Published works usually include a copyright notice, such as “© 1959 by John Doe.” (For sound recordings, the symbol is ℗.) However, a copyright notice is not required for legal protection. Similarly, the fact that a publication is out of print or posted on the internet does not mean it is not copyrighted. Nor does it justify duplicating, distributing, performing, displaying, or making derivatives of it without permission.\nThe Church’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) assists in processing requests to use copyrighted Church materials or programs, including materials that are copyrighted by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. (IRI). IRI is a separate, nonprofit corporation that owns the intellectual property used by the Church. For information on requesting the use of Church-owned materials, see “\nTerms of Use\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe following questions and answers may help members understand and abide by copyright laws when using copyrighted materials at church and at home. If members have questions that are not answered in these guidelines, they may contact the IPO:\nIntellectual Property Office\n50 East North Temple Street\nSalt Lake City, UT 84150-0005\nTelephone: 1-801-240-3959 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-3959\nFax: 1-801-240-1187\nEmail:\ncor-intellectualproperty@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nCan I copy published Church materials?\nUnless otherwise indicated, Church materials may be copied for noncommercial Church, home, and family use. Terms of use that accompany a Church website or app indicate how material on these websites and apps may be used. No commercial use may be made of Church materials without specific written permission from the IPO.\nCan I copy music?\nSpecial copyright laws apply to music. A person may copy music from the following sources for noncommercial Church, home, and family use unless a restriction is noted on the hymn or song:\nHymns\nThe\nChildren’s Songbook\nChurch magazines\nDuplicating printed or recorded music without authorization from the copyright owner is contrary to Church policy.\nCan I copy materials that are not owned by the Church?\nGenerally not. Copyright laws govern the use of privately owned materials. Usually there are restrictions that give the conditions the public must follow before copying non-Church materials. These restrictions are usually listed near the beginning of a publication. Members should strictly observe all copyright laws.\nCan I show commercial audiovisual products at Church functions?\nGenerally not. Church members should not violate warnings and restrictions that are placed on commercial audiovisual products. This includes movies, other video, and music. Using commercial audiovisual products at Church functions generally requires permission from the copyright owners.\nCan I download or duplicate computer software and other programs for Church use?\nGenerally not. Computer programs and other software may not be duplicated or downloaded unless all licenses have been appropriately purchased.\nWhat permission is needed to present musical and theatrical productions?\nProductions that are owned by the Church or IRI may be performed in Church settings without permission from Church headquarters. If a copyrighted production is not owned by the Church, members must obtain the copyright owner’s permission to perform all or part of it in a Church setting. Usually the copyright owner requires fees or royalties even if no charge is made for the performances. All presentations should have the approval of local priesthood leaders.\nThe Church provides materials to help members learn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. These include the scriptures, general conference messages, magazines, manuals, books, and other resources. Leaders encourage members to use the scriptures and other resources as needed to study the gospel at home.\nGospel learning and teaching should focus on the Savior and His doctrine. To help maintain this focus in Church classes, leaders ensure that teachers use approved materials. For information about approved materials, see\nInstructions for Curriculum\n.\nMembers and leaders are encouraged to use member directories provided by the Church. These directories are available in Ward Directory and Map on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\nand in the Member Tools app. They provide basic contact information for members. Stake and ward leaders are able to view additional information helpful for their callings. Leaders can also view this information in Leader and Clerk Resources.\nMembers can restrict the visibility of their digital contact information. They do this by selecting privacy levels in their household profile.\nStake and ward leaders should respect the privacy settings that members select. These leaders also ensure that information is used for approved Church purposes only.\nPrinted stake and ward directories are generally not needed. If leaders determine that there is a genuine need, printed directories may be created only by using Ward Directory and Map on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. These directories do not include the gender, age, or birthday of members.\nMembership lists should not be printed for non-Church use.\nMen and women are created in the image of God (see\nGenesis 1:26–27\n;\nAbraham 4:27\n). Mortal bodies are a sacred gift.\nMembers of the Church are encouraged to show respect for the body in their choices about appropriate dress and appearance. What is appropriate varies across cultures and for different occasions. For example, for sacrament meeting, individuals wear their best available Sunday clothing to show respect for Jesus Christ and the sacrament ordinance (see\n18.9.3\n). This same principle applies to temple attendance (see\n27.1.5\n). Disciples of Jesus Christ will know how best to dress and groom themselves.\nMembers and leaders should not judge others based on dress and appearance. They should love all people, as the Savior commanded (see\nMatthew 22:39\n;\nJohn 13:34–35\n). All should be welcomed at Church meetings and activities (see\n38.1.1\n).\nWhen issuing temple recommends and ward and stake callings, leaders consider worthiness and the guidance of the Spirit (see\n26.3\n,\n30.1.1\n, and\n31.1.1\n).\nThe Church encourages self-reliance. Members are encouraged to be spiritually and physically prepared for life’s challenges. See\n22.1\n.\nHowever, Church leaders have counseled against extreme or excessive preparation for possible catastrophic events. Such efforts are sometimes called survivalism. Efforts to prepare should be motivated by faith, not fear.\nChurch leaders have counseled members not to go into debt to establish food storage. Instead, members should establish a home storage supply and a financial reserve over time. See\n22.1.4\nand “\nFood Storage\n” (Topics and Questions, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nMembers may fast at any time. However, they usually observe the first Sabbath of the month as a fast day.\nA fast day typically includes praying, going without food and drink for a 24-hour period (if physically able), and giving a generous fast offering. A fast offering is a donation to help those in need (see\n22.2.2\n).\nSometimes Churchwide or local meetings are held on the first Sabbath of the month. When this occurs, the stake presidency determines an alternative Sabbath for fast day.\nThe Church opposes and counsels against gambling in any form. This includes sports betting and government-sponsored lotteries.\nFor most Church meetings and activities, speakers and instructors should belong to the local ward or stake.\nA guest speaker or instructor is someone who does not belong to the ward or stake. The bishop’s approval is required before a guest speaker is invited to a ward meeting or activity. The stake president’s approval is required to invite guest speakers to stake meetings or activities.\nThe bishop or stake president carefully screens guest speakers or instructors. This may include contacting the person’s bishop.\nThe bishop or stake president ensures that:\nThe presentation is in harmony with Church doctrine.\nThe presentation does not include speculative topics (topics should be consistent with those addressed in general conference).\nGuest speakers or instructors are not paid a fee, do not recruit participants, and do not solicit customers or clients.\nThe person’s travel expenses are not paid either with local unit budget funds or by private contributions.\nPresentations comply with the guidelines for using Church facilities (see\n35.5\n).\nMembers who remain in their native lands often have opportunities to build up and strengthen the Church there. However, immigration to another country is a personal choice.\nMembers who move to another country should obey all applicable laws (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:21\n).\nMissionaries should not offer to sponsor others’ immigration. Nor should they ask their parents, relatives, or others to do so.\nThe Church does not sponsor immigration through Church employment.\nChurch members offer their time, talents, and friendship to welcome immigrants and refugees as members of their communities (see\nMatthew 25:35\n; see also\n38.8.35\nin this handbook).\nThe Church maintains official websites, blogs, and social media accounts. These resources are clearly identified as official by the use of the Church wordmark or symbol (see\n38.8.8\n). They also comply with legal requirements and the Church’s intellectual property and privacy policies.\nMembers may not create websites, blogs, or social media accounts on behalf of the Church or to officially represent the Church and its views, doctrine, policies, and procedures. However, they may create websites, blogs, or social media accounts to assist with their callings. When doing so, members should comply with the following guidelines:\nThe creation of a website, blog, or social media account must first be approved by the stake president (for stake resources) or bishop (for ward resources).\nThe Church wordmark or symbol may not be used or imitated (see\n38.8.8\n).\nThe online resource should have a purpose and goal and be named accordingly. The name may include a ward or stake name. However, it may not include the official name of the Church.\nMembers may not state or imply that the online resource’s content, images, or other materials are sponsored or endorsed by the Church or officially represent the Church in any way. Rather, a disclaimer should be included stating that it is not an official, Church-sponsored product.\nAll content should be relevant for the intended audience and should be actively moderated.\nThe online resource should include contact information.\nMore than one administrator should be responsible for the online resource. This can provide continuity when a person’s calling or assignment changes. It also keeps one person from being burdened with updating and monitoring the resource.\nChurch-owned artwork, videos, music, or other materials may not be posted unless the use is clearly authorized by the\nTerms of Use\nof an official Church website or by the Church’s Intellectual Property Office. Copyrighted content from other sources should not be used unless the content owner has first given written permission. For more information about using copyrighted material, see\n38.8.11\n.\nWhen using images, videos, or personal information, consent from the content owner or the individuals involved is required. Consent may be obtained through a release form, a public announcement, a posted sign for a specific event, or written permission when needed. The country’s privacy laws should be followed.\nOnline resources should not duplicate tools and features that are already on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, Member Tools, or other Church resources.\nLeaders and missionaries should coordinate to prevent duplicate communication.\nOnline resources should be retired when they are no longer needed. Important media (such as photos and videos) should be preserved in the ward or stake’s history.\nFor additional guidelines, see\ninternet.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe internet and social media have many positive uses. Among these are opportunities to share testimonies of the Savior and His restored gospel. Blogs, social media, and other internet technologies allow members to promote the messages of peace, hope, and joy that accompany faith in Christ.\nMembers are encouraged to share uplifting content. They should also exemplify civility in all online interactions, including social media. They should avoid contention (see\n3 Nephi 11:29–30\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 136:23\n).\nMembers should avoid all statements of prejudice toward others (see\n38.6.14\n). They strive to be Christlike to others at all times, including online, and reflect a sincere respect for all of God’s children.\nMembers should not use threatening, bullying, degrading, violent, or otherwise abusive language or images online. If online threats of illegal acts occur, law enforcement should be contacted immediately.\nMembers should not imply that their messages represent or are sponsored by the Church.\nChurch internet, satellite, and video equipment is to be used only for noncommercial Church purposes. Any use must be authorized by the stake presidency or bishopric.\nThis equipment may not be used to access or record programs that are not sponsored by the Church. Nor may Church resources, such as internet connections, be used to access or record such programs.\nOnly people who are trained to operate the equipment may do so. It should be locked securely when not in use. Equipment may not be removed from the building for personal use.\nMembers should obey, honor, and sustain the laws in any country where they live or travel (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:21–22\n;\nArticles of Faith 1:12\n). This includes laws that prohibit proselyting.\nWhen legal help is needed for Church matters, leaders should contact Church legal counsel. In the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the Church’s Office of General Counsel:\n1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6301\n1-801-240-6301\nOutside the United States and Canada, the stake president contacts the area legal counsel at the area office.\nChurch leaders should not involve themselves in civil or criminal cases for members in their units without first consulting with Church legal counsel. This same policy applies to speaking with or writing to lawyers or court personnel, including through email.\nLeaders should speak with Church legal counsel if, in their Church capacities, they:\nBelieve they should testify or communicate in a legal matter.\nAre being required by legal process to testify or communicate in a legal matter.\nAre ordered to provide evidence.\nAre asked to provide documents or information voluntarily.\nAre asked to communicate with lawyers or civil authorities about legal proceedings, including sentencing or parole hearings.\nHowever well intentioned, Church leaders sharing information in legal proceedings can be misinterpreted and damaging. Such sharing can be especially harmful to victims and their families. Following the Church’s policy also helps keep the Church from being inappropriately implicated in legal matters.\nChurch leaders may not testify on behalf of the Church in any legal proceeding without prior approval from the Office of General Counsel. This policy also applies to sentencing and parole hearings. Church leaders may not provide verbal or written evidence in their leadership capacity without this approval.\nLeaders should not suggest or imply that their testimony in a legal proceeding represents the Church’s position.\nLeaders should not influence the testimony of a witness in any legal proceeding.\nContact information for Church legal counsel is provided in\n38.8.23\n.\nIn many countries, it is a violation of postal regulations to place any material without postage in or on residential mailboxes. This restriction applies to any Church-related materials, such as flyers, newsletters, or announcements. Church leaders should instruct members and missionaries not to place items in or on mailboxes.\nChurch members are discouraged from calling, emailing, or writing letters to General Authorities about doctrinal questions, personal challenges, or requests. Responding personally would make it difficult for General Authorities to fulfill their duties. Members are encouraged to reach out to their local leaders, including their Relief Society or elders quorum president, when seeking spiritual guidance (see\n31.3\n).\nIn most cases, correspondence from members to General Authorities will be referred back to local leaders. A stake president who needs clarification about doctrinal or other Church matters may write in behalf of members to the First Presidency.\nChurch members should seek employment that is consistent with gospel principles and for which they can in good conscience ask the blessings of the Lord. This is a personal matter that is ultimately left to the member’s judgment and prayerful consideration.\nLeaders and members are encouraged to address the needs of all who live within their unit. Members with disabilities are valued and can contribute in meaningful ways. Disabilities may be intellectual, social, emotional, or physical.\nChurch members are encouraged to follow the Savior’s example of offering hope, understanding, and love to those who have disabilities. Leaders should get to know those who have disabilities and show genuine interest and concern.\nLeaders also identify members who may need additional care because a parent, spouse, child, or sibling has a disability. Caring for a family member who has a disability can be both rewarding and challenging.\nLeaders seek out and minister to members with disabilities who are living in group homes or other facilities away from family members.\nLeaders, teachers, and other members seek to understand each individual who has a disability and his or her strengths and needs. They can increase their understanding by talking with the person and his or her family members. Resources are available at\ndisability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nLeaders assess the needs of those who have disabilities and their caregivers. These leaders determine how ward or stake resources could be used to help meet the needs as appropriate. Leaders encourage members to help and reach out in love and friendship.\nThe bishopric or stake presidency may call a ward or stake disability specialist to help individuals, families, teachers, and other leaders (see\n38.8.27.9\n).\nLeaders may also identify appropriate community resources that could help individuals who have disabilities and their families.\nFor more information on assisting persons who have disabilities, see disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Leaders may also contact Family Services (where available; see\n31.3.6\nfor contact information).\nLeaders and members should not attempt to explain why someone has a disability or why a family has a child with a disability. They should not suggest that a disability is a punishment from God (see\nJohn 9:2–3\n) or a special privilege.\nSee\n38.2.4\n.\nMany members with disabilities can serve in nearly any Church assignment. Leaders prayerfully consider the abilities, circumstances, and desires of each person and then provide appropriate opportunities to serve. Leaders also counsel with the individual and his or her family. They consider the effects of a Church calling on the person and his or her family or caregiver. (See\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:15\n.)\nWhen considering Church assignments or callings for caregivers of people with disabilities, leaders carefully evaluate the circumstances of the caregivers.\nLeaders and teachers should include members with disabilities in meetings, classes, and activities as fully as possible. Lessons, talks, and teaching methods should be adapted to meet each person’s needs. For information about adapting lessons, see disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nThe bishopric may invite a ward member to help a person with a disability in a meeting or activity. For a class that includes a member with disabilities, the bishopric may call multiple teachers. The teachers work together to meet the needs of all class members.\nIf a person cannot participate in a meeting, class, or activity, leaders and teachers may consult with the member and his or her family about how to meet the member’s needs. The stake president or bishop may approve organizing special classes or programs for members with disabilities (see\n38.8.27.5\n). If a person is not able to attend Church meetings, leaders and teachers may provide lesson materials, recordings, or streaming.\nStreaming of events, including sacrament meetings and funerals, is intended only for those who cannot attend in person (see\n29.7\n). For more information about partaking of the sacrament, see\n18.9.3\n.\nLeaders encourage priesthood holders who have disabilities to participate in ordinances when appropriate. Beginning in January of the year they turn 12, priesthood holders and young women who have been baptized and confirmed and who are worthy may be baptized and confirmed for the dead in a temple. For guidelines about members with disabilities receiving their own temple ordinances, see\n27.2.1.3\nand\n27.3.1.2\n.\nMembers who have disabilities or special needs are encouraged to attend Sunday meetings in their wards unless they live in a care facility or residential treatment program where Church programs are organized (see\n37.6\n).\nUnits and groups.\nWards or branches may be created for members who have unique needs, such as those who are deaf and use sign language (see\n37.1\n). Approval is given only by the First Presidency.\nA ward may be asked to host a group for those with disabilities, such as those who use sign language. For information about the membership records of those attending such units or groups, see\n33.6.11\n.\nDeaf members who do not live within a reasonable distance from a deaf unit may attend one virtually. They should obtain permission from the leaders of that unit. Local ward leaders ensure that deaf members are cared for and have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament regularly.\nClasses.\nMembers with disabilities attend Sunday classes with the members of their ward. However, when needed to meet the needs of adult or youth members with similar disabilities, a ward or stake may organize special Sunday School classes (see\n13.3.2\n).\nDisability activity programs.\nWhen needed to meet the needs of adult members with intellectual disabilities, a ward, group of wards, stake, or group of stakes may organize a disability activity program. This program supplements ministering, Sunday Church services, and activities in the local unit.\nA disability activity program typically serves individuals ages 18 and older. Every effort should be made to integrate members under 18 into their wards and stakes. In unusual situations, leaders may provide supplemental activities for youth beginning in the year they turn 12.\nWhen multiple wards participate in a disability activity program, the stake president assigns an agent bishop to oversee it. When multiple stakes participate, the Area Presidency assigns an agent stake president to oversee it.\nThe agent bishop or agent stake president consults with other participating bishops or stake presidents to determine how these programs will be funded.\nDisability activity leaders.\nAdult members may be called as disability activity leaders. These leaders plan and carry out the disability activity program. They consult with ward and stake disability specialists (see\n38.8.27.9\n) to invite members with disabilities to participate. They counsel together about how to meet those members’ needs.\nDisability activity leaders are called and set apart under the direction of the agent bishop or agent stake president. A stake president may also assign a high councilor to serve as a disability activity leader.\nLeaders serving those of any age with disabilities complete the training at\nProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. For additional safety requirements for leaders, see\nActivities for Members with Disabilities\n.\nWhen invited, disability activity leaders may attend stake or ward leadership meetings.\nGuidelines for disability activity programs.\nDisability activity programs are organized to help participants develop spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually (see\nLuke 2:52\n). Leaders determine the frequency of activities. They consider the number of participants, travel distances, and other circumstances.\nSome people may not be able to participate because of complex medical, physical, intellectual, or behavioral circumstances. Leaders seek other ways to minister to their needs.\nParticipation and safety standards.\nAt least two responsible adults must be present at all activities. The two adults could be two men, two women, or a married couple. Generally, more adults are needed to supervise activities for members with disabilities than are needed for other activities.\nAdults who help with activities complete the training at\nProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. They must receive approval from their bishop before participating. For additional safety requirements, see “\nActivities for Members with Disabilities\n.”\nIf inappropriate behavior occurs, leaders’ immediate responsibility is to protect and help the vulnerable person. For information about responding to suspected abuse, see\n38.6.2.1\nand\nabuse.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nMembers who are deaf or hard of hearing take initiative in working with leaders to meet communication needs. Members and leaders work together to ensure that interpreters are available.\nInterpreters should be located where members can see them as well as the person speaking.\nDuring an ordinance or interview, the interpreter sits or stands close to the person who performs the ordinance or conducts the interview. For more information on interpreting ordinances and blessings, see\n38.2.1\n.\nIf enough interpreters are available, they rotate approximately every 30 minutes to avoid fatigue.\nIn preparation for sensitive situations such as personal interviews or Church membership councils, leaders counsel with the deaf member. When the member desires, leaders seek an interpreter who is not a family member to preserve confidentiality.\nThese same principles apply for members who are deaf or hard of hearing and do not use sign language but need an oral interpreter to help them read lips.\nLeaders may organize ward or stake classes to teach the sign language that is used in their area. A helpful resource is\nDictionary of Sign Language Terms for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n.\nLeaders should respect the privacy of members with disabilities both during and outside of leadership meetings where needs are discussed. Leaders do not share diagnoses or other personal information without permission.\nBishops and stake presidents may determine whether to allow persons with disabilities to use trained service dogs in meetinghouses. Other types of animals, including emotional support animals (comfort pets), are generally not permitted in meetinghouses or at Church-sponsored events, except as specifically required by law. (In general in the United States, the Church is under no legal obligation to admit service dogs or emotional support animals to houses of worship.) Bishops and stake presidents make local decisions. They take into account the needs of persons with disabilities and the needs of others in the congregation.\nFor additional guidelines on the use of service animals in Church facilities, see\n27.1.3\nand disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nThe bishopric or stake presidency may call a ward or stake disability specialist. The specialist helps members with disabilities and their caregivers participate in Church meetings and activities and feel included.\nThe specialist serves members and leaders in the following ways:\nGet to know individuals with disabilities and their families.\nRespond to disability-related questions and concerns from caregivers, leaders, and others.\nHelp individuals access Church materials, meetings, and activities. This may occur through using technology and in other ways (see\n38.8.27.10\n).\nIdentify meaningful opportunities for members with disabilities to serve.\nIdentify specific needs of families and, where appropriate, identify community, ward, and stake resources.\nThe specialist can help members with disabilities and their caregivers share information about the disability with others.\nResources for members with disabilities, for their families and caregivers, and for leaders and teachers are available at disability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. This website provides:\nInformation to help increase understanding of the challenges faced by those who have disabilities.\nResources to help members who have disabilities and their families find comfort in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nListings of Church materials in formats that are accessible to members with disabilities (see also\nstore.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nQuestions may be addressed to:\nMembers with Disabilities\n50 East North Temple Street\nSalt Lake City, UT 84150-0024\nTelephone: 1-801-240-2477 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-2477\nEmail:\ndisability@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nChurch leaders are encouraged to follow the Savior’s example of offering hope, understanding, and love to those who are affected by crime and those who are incarcerated (see\nMatthew 25:34–36, 40\n).\nStake presidents direct prison ministry efforts. These efforts include supporting adults and youth who are in custody or have recently been released from prison or jail. This work also includes caring for families and children with an incarcerated parent or loved one.\nLeaders who have a prison or jail within their unit boundaries should take steps to become aware of ministering opportunities and needs. For resources and guidelines, leaders may contact the Church’s Prison Ministry Division:\nEmail:\nPrisonMinistry@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nTelephone: 1-801-240-2644 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-2644\nMuch that is inspiring, noble, and worthy of the highest respect is found in many other faiths. Missionaries and other members must be sensitive and respectful toward the beliefs and traditions of others. They must also avoid giving offense.\nStake and mission presidents who have questions about relationships with other faiths should contact the Area Presidency. Other local leaders who have such questions should contact the stake or mission president.\nChurch members are encouraged to participate in political and governmental affairs. In many countries, this may include:\nVoting.\nJoining or serving in political parties.\nProviding financial support.\nCommunicating with party officials and candidates.\nParticipating in peaceful, legal protests.\nServing in elected or appointed offices in local and national government.\nMembers are also encouraged to participate in worthy causes to make their communities wholesome places to live and raise families.\nIn accordance with local laws, members are encouraged to register to vote and to study issues and candidates carefully. Principles compatible with the gospel may be found in various political parties. Latter-day Saints have a special obligation to seek out and uphold leaders who are honest, good, and wise (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 98:10\n).\nThe Church is neutral regarding political parties, political platforms, and candidates for political office. The Church does not endorse any political party or candidate. Nor does it advise members how to vote.\nIn exceptional cases, when moral issues or the Church’s practices are involved, the Church may take a position on political matters. In such cases, the Church may engage in political discourse to represent its views. Only the First Presidency can authorize:\nExpressing the Church’s position on moral issues.\nCommitting the Church to support or oppose specific legislation.\nSharing the Church’s perspective on judicial matters.\nLocal Church leaders should not organize members to participate in political matters. Nor should leaders attempt to influence how members participate.\nChurch members who seek elected or appointed public office should not imply that they are endorsed by the Church or its leaders. Leaders and members should also avoid statements or conduct that might be interpreted as Church endorsement of any political party, platform, policy, or candidate.\nEven when taking a position on a political matter, the Church does not ask elected officials to vote a certain way or to take a certain position. Members who are elected officials make their own decisions. These officials might not agree with one another or with a publicly stated Church position. They do not speak for the Church.\nPolitical choices and affiliations should not be the subject of any teachings or advocating in Church settings. Leaders ensure that Church meetings and activities focus on the Savior and His gospel.\nMembers should not judge one another in political matters. Faithful Latter-day Saints can belong to a variety of political parties and vote for a variety of candidates. All should feel welcome in Church settings.\nChurch records, directories, and similar materials may not be used for political purposes.\nChurch facilities may not be used for political purposes. However, facilities may be used for voting or voter registration where there is not a reasonable alternative (see\n35.5.6.3\n).\nChurch leaders are obligated to protect the privacy of members. Church records, directories, and similar materials may not be used for personal, commercial, or political purposes (see also\n38.8.13\n).\nWard and stake leaders should not store or share confidential Church information outside of Church-provided applications, systems, or internet services. Examples of confidential Church information include a person’s:\nMembership status.\nTemporal needs.\nOther personal information that is not publicly available.\nCommunications from individuals or government offices that refer to data privacy laws should be promptly referred to the Church Data Privacy Office.\nEmail:\nDataPrivacyOfficer@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nWard and stake leaders should not respond to these requests.\nFor the Church’s privacy notice, see “\nPrivacy Notice\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Members may also ask stake or ward leaders to help them access the policy.\nMembers should not ask General Authorities, General Officers, or Area Seventies to coauthor or endorse Church books or other Church writings.\nMembers should not record, transcribe, or stream messages by General Authorities, General Officers, and Area Seventies. However, some meetings where these leaders speak can be streamed under the direction of the bishop or stake president. For information, see\n29.7\n.\nMembers may record broadcasts of general conference on home equipment for personal, noncommercial use.\nThe name of the Church was given by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1838: “For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:4\n). Referring to the Church and its members in the ways described below identifies a connection between Jesus Christ and members of His Church.\nReferences to the Church should include its full name whenever possible. Following an initial reference to the full name, if a shortened reference is needed, the following terms are accurate and encouraged:\nThe Church\nThe Church of Jesus Christ\nThe restored Church of Jesus Christ\nWhen referring to Church members, the following terms are accurate and preferred:\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nLatter-day Saints (this is a name given by the Lord to His covenant people in the latter days)\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ\nReferring to Church members by other titles, such as “Mormons” or “LDS,” is discouraged.\nMormon\nis correctly used in proper names such as the Book of Mormon. It is also correctly used as an adjective in historical expressions such as “Mormon Trail.”\nThe term\nMormonism\nis inaccurate, and its use is discouraged. When describing the combination of doctrine, culture, and lifestyle unique to the Church, the phrase “the restored gospel of Jesus Christ” is accurate and preferred.\nMany people have fled their homes seeking relief from violence, war, religious persecution, and life-threatening situations. As part of their responsibility to care for those in need (see\nMosiah 4:26\n), Church members offer their time, talents, and friendship to welcome refugees as members of their communities. See\nMatthew 25:35\n;\nChurchofJesusChrist.org/refugees\n.\nThe established programs of the Church provide financial help for people in need and for appropriate causes.\nChurch assistance to members in need is administered by bishops (see\n22.3.2\n). Bishops follow established principles and policies to help ensure that Church funds are used properly (see\n22.4\nand\n22.5\n).\nMembers in need are encouraged to speak with their bishop instead of contacting Church headquarters or requesting money from other Church leaders or members. The bishop will likely ask leaders from the elders quorum or Relief Society to help assess needs.\nThe purpose of Church research is to gather reliable information to support the deliberations of general Church leaders. The Correlation Research Division (CRD) is the only authorized research agency of the Church. CRD may also contract with third-party agencies to conduct research.\nWhen Church-authorized researchers contact members or leaders, they provide a CRD employee’s contact information. This employee can answer questions about the research.\nCRD seeks to protect the identity and responses of research participants. Persons may decline to participate at any time. They may choose not to answer any or all questions.\nParents or guardians must give consent before children under 18 are invited to participate in a study.\nLocal leaders should not approve any research related to the Church. This includes using members as research subjects.\nCRD abides by all data privacy laws. Local leaders should also abide by these laws and should not provide members’ personal information to unauthorized researchers and research agencies.\nSome research requires collecting information in Church meetings. This is especially true if the meeting is the focus of the study. In such cases, CRD will work with local leaders to ensure that the presence of researchers does not detract from the meetings.\nTo verify any research request, contact the Correlation Research Division:\nTelephone: 1-801-240-2727 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-2727\nEmail:\nresearch@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nThe Church works to fulfill Jesus Christ’s commandment to take the gospel to all the world (see\nMatthew 28:19\n). Missionaries serve only in countries where they are officially recognized and welcomed by local governments.\nThe Church and its members respect all laws and requirements with regard to missionary efforts. For example, in some parts of the world, missionaries are sent only to serve humanitarian or other specialized missions. Those missionaries do not proselytize. The Church does not send missionaries to some countries.\nMany Church welfare and self-reliance operations have equipment and machinery that can cause injury if it is not used properly. Agent stake presidents (or those they assign) and managers of these operations should ensure the safety of employees and volunteers.\nWorkers should be instructed regularly in safety practices. The work environment should be inspected periodically. Health and safety hazards should be corrected. Adequate supervision should always be provided to ensure that workers follow instructions, use tools and equipment properly, and avoid hazardous behavior.\nNormally those who work at these operations should be age 16 or older. Those who operate equipment should be mature, adequately trained, and experienced in using it. Only adults may operate power equipment.\nIf an accident occurs, the operations manager reports it to the following:\nWelfare and Self-Reliance Services: 1-801-240-3001 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-3001\nRisk Management Division at Church headquarters (see\n20.7.6.3\nfor contact information)\nThe Church identifies editions of the Bible that align well with the Lord’s doctrine in the Book of Mormon and modern revelation (see\nArticles of Faith 1:8\n). A preferred edition of the Bible is then chosen for many languages spoken by Church members.\nIn some languages, the Church publishes its own edition of the Bible. Church-published editions are based on standard Bible texts. Examples include:\nThe King James Version in English.\nThe Reina-Valera (2009) in Spanish.\nThe Almeida (2015) in Portuguese.\nChurch-published editions of the Bible include footnotes, subject indexes, and other study aids.\nGenerally, members should use a preferred or Church-published edition of the Bible in Church classes and meetings. This helps maintain clarity in discussions and consistent understanding of doctrine. Other Bible translations may also be used. Some individuals may benefit from translations that are doctrinally clear and also easier to understand. Examples of such translations can be found in the Church’s\nHoly Bible list\n. When members encounter doctrinal discrepancies between Bible translations, they should refer to the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and teachings of latter-day prophets.\nThe Lord directed His prophets and apostles to preserve the scriptures in safety (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:56\n). The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles closely supervises the translation of Church scriptures. Using approved processes helps ensure doctrinal accuracy and preserve evidence of the text’s origins.\nArea Presidencies submit official requests for new translations of the scriptures to the Church Correlation Department.\nAny other efforts to translate scripture text are not authorized. This policy applies to translations accomplished by traditional methods, artificial intelligence, or other means.\nThe Church publishes simplified scripture stories intended for children. The Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has not authorized any other efforts to update or rewrite scripture text into modern or informal language. This policy applies to efforts accomplished by traditional methods, artificial intelligence, or other means.\nPrinted copies of scriptures, including some preferred editions of the Bible, are available from Church Distribution Services. Preferred editions of the Bible may also be available at local booksellers, online, and in Bible mobile applications. Electronic text and audio recordings of Church-published editions and some preferred editions are available in the Gospel Library app and at\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. These resources also provide\nlists of scriptures\nthat are available by language.\nIn today’s world, information is easy to access and share. This can be a great blessing for those seeking to be educated and informed. However, many sources of information are unreliable and do not edify. Some sources seek to promote anger, contention, fear, or baseless conspiracy theories (see\n3 Nephi 11:30\n;\nMosiah 2:32\n). Therefore, it is important that Church members be wise as they seek truth.\nMembers of the Church should seek out and share only credible, reliable, and factual sources of information. They should avoid sources that are speculative or founded on rumor. The guidance of the Holy Ghost, along with careful study, can help members discern between truth and error (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 11:12\n;\n45:57\n). In matters of doctrine and Church policy, the authoritative sources are the scriptures, the teachings of the living prophets, and the\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nThe Church warns members against seminars and similar gatherings that include presentations that:\nDisparage, ridicule, or are otherwise inappropriate in their treatment of sacred matters.\nCould injure the Church, detract from its mission, or jeopardize the well-being of its members or leaders.\nMembers should not allow their position or standing in the Church to be used to promote or imply endorsement of such gatherings.\nFor more information, see\n35.5\n,\n38.6.12\n, and\n38.7.8\n. See also\nJacob 6:12\n.\nLeaders provide support to members in hospitals and care centers within their units. They follow guidelines established by the facilities.\nFor information about administering the sacrament for members in these facilities, see\n18.9.1\n. For information about creating a ward or branch, see\n37.6\n.\nWard and stake leaders ensure that local Church activities do not jeopardize the Church’s tax-exempt status. For guidelines, see\n34.8.1\n.\nChurch members are to obey the tax laws of the nation where they live (see\nArticles of Faith 1:12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 134:5\n). Members who disagree with tax laws can challenge them as the laws of their countries permit.\nChurch members are in conflict with the law and with Church teachings if they:\nIntentionally fail or refuse to pay required taxes.\nMake frivolous legal arguments to avoid paying taxes.\nRefuse to comply with a final judgment in a tax proceeding that requires them to pay taxes.\nThese members may be ineligible for a temple recommend. They should not be called to leadership positions in the Church.\nA Church membership council is required if a member is convicted of a felony for violating tax laws (see\n32.6.1.5\n).\nA man and a woman should not travel alone together for Church activities, meetings, or assignments unless they are married to each other or are both single. For other travel policies, see\n20.7.7\n.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) presents opportunities and risks, and is continuously changing. AI can enhance learning, facilitate communication, and foster innovation. However, AI cannot substitute for the individual effort or divine inspiration required for personal spiritual growth or genuine relationships with God and others.\nAI should be used responsibly. Church members should not use AI to create or disseminate anything that is false, misleading, illegal, or harmful. They should verify AI-generated output for accuracy.\nAI cannot replace the gift of divine inspiration or the individual work required to receive it. However, AI can be a useful tool to enhance learning and teaching.\nJesus Christ taught with power and authority (see\nMatthew 7:28–29\n). He sought divine direction from His Father. He relied on the scriptures (see\nMatthew 4:3–10\n) and prayer (see\nLuke 6:12\n). He lived and taught only those things He learned from His Father (see\nJohn 8:28\n;\n12:49–50\n).\nChurch members teach the gospel of Jesus Christ from the scriptures and the words of the living prophets as guided by the Holy Ghost (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:11–17\n;\n52:9\n). As they seek learning by study, faith, and prayer (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:85\n;\n88:118\n), they invite the Spirit to inspire their minds and hearts (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\n;\n11:12–14\n). Through personal effort and the gift of revelation, they can teach God’s word by the power of the Spirit (see\nAlma 17:2–3\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:17–22\n).\nInteractions with AI cannot substitute for meaningful relationships with God and others.\nJesus Christ had a personal and sacred relationship with His Father (see\nMatthew 3:17\n;\nJohn 17\n). He prayed to His Father (see\nMatthew 6:9–13\n), learned from Him (see\nJohn 8:28\n), and fulfilled His will (see\n3 Nephi 27:13\n).\nJesus also had meaningful relationships with others (see\nLuke 2:52\n). He listened to and talked with them, understood their needs, and ministered to them (see\nJohn 4:5–30\n;\nLuke 24:13–35\n).\nChurch members are encouraged to follow the Savior’s example by developing genuine relationships with God and others. This requires humility, consistent effort, and patience.\nLeaders and members seek divine inspiration to fulfill their callings and assignments. When used appropriately, AI can be an effective tool to assist them in their duties.\nThe following principles should guide leaders and members in the appropriate use of AI in their Church responsibilities:\nIf members use AI, they should do so in positive, helpful, and uplifting ways that uphold the integrity, standards, and teachings of the Church.\nAI cannot replace the individual work and spiritual guidance required to prepare divinely inspired talks, lessons, prayers, or blessings. However, AI can be helpful for research, editing, translation, and similar tasks.\nLeaders should not rely upon AI to provide advice to members on medical, financial, legal, or other sensitive matters. If members need assistance beyond the spiritual guidance provided by Church leaders, competent professionals may be helpful (see\n31.3.6\n).\nSensitive information, such as Church records, personal member data, or confidential communications, should not be entered into AI tools that are not provided or managed by the Church.\nFor more information, see\nChurchofJesusChrist.org/AI\n.\nStake presidents and bishops help make the blessings of Church participation available to members who serve in the military. The Church’s military relations and chaplain services program consists of:\nSupport from stakes and wards.\nChurch orientation for members who enter military service.\nOrganization of wards, branches, or Latter-day Saint service member groups.\nEndorsement of and support from Latter-day Saint chaplains.\nInformation on how to wear the garment in the military.\nSupport from senior missionary couples assigned to selected military installations.\nIf military installations or members who serve in the military are in a stake, the stake presidency has the responsibilities outlined in this section. If such installations are located in a mission rather than a stake, the mission president fulfills these responsibilities.\nA member of the stake presidency oversees military relations in the stake. He may call a man or a woman to serve as the military relations specialist. This member does not need to have military experience. He or she ensures that resources are provided to support members of the military in the stake. This includes the military service orientation (see\n38.9.3\n).\nIf Church services are held on a military installation, the president of a stake where the installation is located organizes one of the following for military personnel and their families (see\n38.9.4\n):\nA ward with a bishopric (when authorized by the First Presidency)\nA branch with a branch presidency\nA service member group with a service member group leader and assistants\nThe stake president calls, sets apart, and oversees the leaders of these units. He gives these leaders’ contact information to the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division. He may designate a ward to support each service member group.\nThe stake president works with the Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division to provide a letter of appointment to each bishop, branch president, or group leader. This letter outlines his responsibilities and authorizes him to preside over the unit and conduct meetings. A copy of the letter should be given to the installation chaplain.\nThe United States military requires that a chaplain provide administrative oversight to any religious service held on a military installation. If there is a Latter-day Saint chaplain on the installation, he normally provides such oversight to a Church unit that meets there. The chaplain does not preside at the worship services unless he is the bishop, branch president, or group leader. However, he is expected to attend and participate.\nA member of the stake presidency coordinates with the senior chaplain at each military installation in the stake. He ensures that bishops of wards whose boundaries encompass a military installation do the same. These leaders inform the chaplain of the ward’s meeting schedule, meeting location, and contact person. The chaplain can give this information to members at the installation.\nThe stake president annually interviews each Latter-day Saint chaplain who lives in the stake. He determines the chaplain’s well-being and worthiness to serve. The stake president also separately interviews each chaplain’s spouse annually.\nChaplains and their spouses should have ward or stake callings. A chaplain who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood may serve in leadership callings, such as on the high council or presiding over a military ward, branch, or service member group. However, this calling cannot conflict with his military duties.\nChaplains may assist the stake president in the following ways:\nReport in stake council meetings on Church units meeting on military installations. These reports should include information about new and returning members.\nServe as the liaison between military leaders and the stake president.\nHelp the stake president identify members in the military to call as service member group leaders.\nAssist with efforts to strengthen new and returning Church members in the military.\nHelp prepare members in the military to receive sacred ordinances and keep their covenants.\nA member of the bishopric meets with ward members before they leave for military service. He ensures they have an opportunity to attend the military service orientation (see\n38.9.3\n).\nFor information about the membership records for a member entering the military, see\n33.6.9\n. Some members are assigned to a remote or isolated location or are deployed to a war zone. In these cases, the bishop contacts the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division for guidance about membership records (see\n38.9.10\n).\nLeaders in the home ward should correspond regularly with each ward member who is away in military service.\nThe bishop coordinates with the senior chaplain at each military installation in the ward.\nThe military service orientation helps members entering and serving in the military know what to expect regarding Church services and activities in the military. It also teaches them how to strengthen their faith and keep their covenants during military service.\nA member of the stake presidency or bishopric calls a military service instructor to provide the orientation. Preferably this instructor has had recent military experience. If a qualified instructor is not available, the stake president or bishop contacts the Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division for guidance.\nFor more information, see the “Military Service Orientation” section in the\nChurch’s Military Members page\n.\nMembers in the military normally participate in wards located near their military installations. However, in the following circumstances, the stake or mission president may organize a ward, branch, or service member group for military personnel and their families at the installation:\nThere is no ward within a reasonable distance of the military installation.\nMilitary personnel do not understand the language spoken in the local ward.\nMilitary personnel are unable to leave the military installation because of training requirements or other restrictions.\nThe members’ military unit is or will be deployed to a location where one of the following applies:\nThe Church is not organized.\nThe local Church unit cannot accommodate the members because of a different language.\nAttendance at local meetings is not feasible.\nMembers belong to Reserve or National Guard units and participate in weekend drills or annual training exercises.\nWards and branches at military installations are created using the procedures outlined in\nchapter 37\n.\nWards and branches are usually established to support both military members and their families. A ward or branch may also be established for military members without their families. Such units may be established for members attending basic or advanced training or on a remote assignment. The military does not normally allow Church members who are not associated with the military to belong to a ward or branch that uses installation facilities.\nIf the number of members or if other circumstances do not justify creating a ward or branch at a military installation, the stake or mission president may establish a service member group. A service member group is a small Church unit that holds Church meetings and looks after members. The group leader does not have priesthood keys. Because of this, he is not authorized to receive tithes and offerings, counsel members about serious sins, restrict membership privileges, or perform other duties that require keys (see\n37.7\n).\nFor information about service member groups, see the “Find a Church Location or Leader” and “Information for Group Leaders” sections in the\nChurch’s Military Members page\n.\nWhen a Church unit is established at a military installation, the unit leader coordinates with the senior installation chaplain to arrange for meeting times and use of base facilities. If there is not an installation chaplain assigned to the base, the stake president consults with the commanding officer.\nStake or mission presidents normally call and set apart service member group leaders. However, this may not be possible in some remote locations or war zones. Since a group leader is not given priesthood keys with his calling, it is permissible for him to be appointed without being set apart. The priesthood leader who is responsible for the location can appoint a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as the group leader. He first verifies the man’s worthiness with his bishop and stake president. If a Latter-day Saint chaplain is in the area, the priesthood leader can authorize him to call and set apart a group leader.\nService member group leaders in isolated locations may obtain Church supplies and materials by contacting the Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division (see\n38.9.10\n).\nSometimes a deployed service member is isolated from other Church members. If the service member holds the Melchizedek Priesthood or is a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, his bishop may authorize him to administer and partake of the sacrament. If there is more than one member at a deployed location, a group leader should be called.\nThe Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division should be notified when a group leader is called. A letter of appointment will be sent to him (see\n38.9.1.1\n).\nFor countries with mandatory military service, Church members must generally complete their military service before they can serve a mission. Some countries may allow the mandatory military service to be deferred until after missionary service. Stake presidents and bishops should become familiar with their country’s requirements so they can advise members appropriately. Members serving in the Reserves or National Guard may be able to serve missions after they complete basic and advanced training.\nFor more information, see the “Missionary Service and Military Obligations” section in the\nChurch’s Military Members page\n.\nThe Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division provides centralized endorsement for male and female chaplains who serve in a variety of government and nongovernment settings. These settings include:\nThe military.\nHospitals.\nHospice organizations.\nPrisons.\nDetention centers.\nPolice and fire departments.\nBorder patrol.\nCivic and veteran organizations.\nColleges and universities.\nEach organization establishes its own educational and ministry requirements for chaplains. Most organizations require Church endorsement before a person may serve as a Latter-day Saint chaplain. The Church’s Military Relations and Chaplain Services Division provides endorsement for all Latter-day Saint chaplains. Letters of endorsement from bishops and stake presidents are not sufficient and should not be provided.\nLatter-day Saint chaplains:\nServe people of all faiths, including Latter-day Saints.\nEnsure that individuals are afforded religious freedom.\nHelp facilitate or accommodate the religious needs of those they serve.\nFor more information, see “\nLatter-day Saint Chaplains\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nSee\n38.5.7\n.\nRetired military couples may be called to serve as military relations missionaries at selected military bases. They assist local priesthood leaders in strengthening new and returning members. They also provide support to families of deployed service members during periods of family separation.\nFor information about membership records of service members, see\n33.6.9\n.\nFor information about patriarchal blessings for service members, see\n38.2.10.3\n.\nFor information about ordaining service members in isolated locations, see\n38.2.9.6\n.\nFor information about issuing temple recommends in isolated locations, see\n26.3.4\n.\nIf Church leaders have questions about military relations, they may contact:\nMilitary Relations and Chaplain Services Division\n50 East North Temple Street, Room 2411\nSalt Lake City, UT 84150-0024\nTelephone: 1-801-240-2286\nEmail:\npst-military@ChurchofJesusChrist.org",
