  "content": "Thoughtfully\n1.\nI stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,\nConfused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.\nI tremble to know that for me he was crucified,\nThat for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.\n[Chorus]\nOh, it is wonderful that he should care for me\nEnough to die for me!\nOh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!\n2.\nI marvel that he would descend from his throne divine\nTo rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,\nThat he should extend his great love unto such as I,\nSufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.\n[Chorus]\nOh, it is wonderful that he should care for me\nEnough to die for me!\nOh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!\n3.\nI think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!\nSuch mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?\nNo, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,\nUntil at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.\n[Chorus]\nOh, it is wonderful that he should care for me\nEnough to die for me!\nOh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!\nText and music:\nCharles H. Gabriel, 1856–1932\nMosiah 3:5–8\nJohn 15:13",
