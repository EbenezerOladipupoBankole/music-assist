  "content": "With commitment\n1.\nI’m trying to be like Jesus;\nI’m following in his ways.\nI’m trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say.\nAt times I am tempted to make a wrong choice,\nBut I try to listen as the still small voice whispers,\n[Chorus]\n“Love one another as Jesus loves you.\nTry to show kindness in all that you do.\nBe gentle and loving in deed and in thought,\nFor these are the things Jesus taught.”\n2.\nI’m trying to love my neighbor;\nI’m learning to serve my friends.\nI watch for the day of gladness when Jesus will come again.\nI try to remember the lessons he taught.\nThen the Holy Spirit enters into my thoughts, saying:\n[Chorus]\n“Love one another as Jesus loves you.\nTry to show kindness in all that you do.\nBe gentle and loving in deed and in thought,\nFor these are the things Jesus taught.”\nWords and music:\nJanice Kapp Perry, b. 1938\n© 1980 by Janice Kapp Perry.
