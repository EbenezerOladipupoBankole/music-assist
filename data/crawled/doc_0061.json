  "content": "1\nSing\n, O\nbarren\n, thou\nthat\ndidst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou\nthat\ndidst not travail with child: for more\nare\nthe children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the\nLord\n.\n2\nEnlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains\nof thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy\nstakes\n;\n3\nFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.\n4\nFear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the\nshame\nof thy youth, and shalt not remember the\nreproach\nof thy widowhood any more.\n5\nFor thy Maker\nis\nthine\nhusband\n; the\nLord\nof hosts\nis\nhis name; and thy\nRedeemer\nthe Holy One of Israel; The\nGod\nof the whole earth shall he be called.\n6\nFor the\nLord\nhath called thee as a\nwoman\nforsaken\nand grieved in spirit, and a\nwife\nof youth,\nwhen thou wast refused\n, saith thy God.\n7\nFor a small\nmoment\nhave I\nforsaken\nthee; but with great mercies will I\ngather\nthee.\n8\nIn a little\nwrath\nI\nhid\nmy\nface\nfrom thee for a moment; but with everlasting\nkindness\nwill I have\nmercy\non thee, saith the\nLord\nthy Redeemer.\n9\nFor this\nis as\nthe waters of Noah unto me: for\nas\nI have sworn that the\nwaters of Noah\nshould no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.\n10\nFor the\nmountains\nshall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the\ncovenant\nof my peace be removed, saith the\nLord\nthat hath mercy on thee.\n11\n¶\nO thou afflicted, tossed with tempest,\nand\nnot comforted, behold, I will lay thy\nstones\nwith fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.\n12\nAnd I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\n13\nAnd all thy\nchildren\nshall be\ntaught\nof the\nLord\n; and great\nshall be\nthe\npeace\nof thy children.\n14\nIn righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.\n15\nBehold, they shall surely gather together,\nbut\nnot by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.\n16\nBehold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the\nwaster\nto destroy.\n17\n¶\nNo\nweapon\nthat is formed against thee shall prosper; and every\ntongue\nthat\nshall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This\nis\nthe heritage of the\nservants\nof the\nLord\n, and their righteousness\nis\nof me, saith the\nLord\n.",
