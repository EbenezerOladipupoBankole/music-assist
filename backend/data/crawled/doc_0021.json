Primary,”\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nThe Primary organization helps God’s children prepare to return to His presence. As they embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they will “be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works” (\nMosiah 5:15\n).\nPrimary helps children:\nFeel their Heavenly Father’s love and learn about His plan of happiness.\nLearn about Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father’s plan.\nLearn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nFeel, recognize, and act on the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nPrepare for, make, and keep sacred covenants.\nParticipate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation.\nThe Primary theme is a reminder of the blessings of serving in Primary:\n“All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children” (\nIsaiah 54:13\n;\n3 Nephi 22:13\n).\nNursery helps children 18 months to 3 years feel Heavenly Father’s love and learn about His plan of happiness.\nNursery leaders love, teach, and minister to the children. They also ensure their safety and well-being.\nAt least two people should be called for each nursery class. If the nursery leaders are not husband and wife, they should be the same gender.\nNursery lasts the entire time scheduled for Primary. For more information, see\n12.1.4\nand\n12.3.5\n.\nPrimary classes help children feel Heavenly Father’s love and learn about His plan of happiness. Lessons follow the\nCome, Follow Me\ncurriculum. On fifth Sundays, teachers are encouraged to use “\nAppendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nPrimary classes are organized by age and the number of teachers available. Units with fewer children or teachers may combine two or more age-groups into one class. In larger units, Primary leaders may form more than one class for an age-group and more than one nursery.\nWhen there are enough children, they are divided into classes based on their age on December 31 of the previous year, as shown on the following chart:\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\nClass on January 1\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n2\nClass on January 1\nNursery (children join nursery at 18 months)\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n3\nClass on January 1\nSunbeam\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n4\nClass on January 1\nCTR 4\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n5\nClass on January 1\nCTR 5\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n6\nClass on January 1\nCTR 6\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n7\nClass on January 1\nValiant 7\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n8\nClass on January 1\nValiant 8\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n9\nClass on January 1\nValiant 9\nAge on December 31 of the Previous Year\n10\nClass on January 1\nValiant 10\nChildren generally advance from Primary into Young Women or the deacons quorum in January of the year they turn 12. They may receive a\ncertificate of advancement\n. These certificates may be generated in Leader and Clerk Resources.\nIn some circumstances, an 11-year-old may not be ready to leave Primary. The bishop, parents, and child counsel together about the timing.\nChildren may not complete Primary before January of the year they turn 12. Nor may young men be ordained deacons before that time.\nSinging time helps children feel Heavenly Father’s love and learn about His plan of happiness. As children sing about gospel principles, the Holy Ghost testifies of their truthfulness. The words and music will stay in the children’s minds and hearts throughout their lives.\nSinging time is different from class time. During singing time, children learn as they actively engage in singing. Primary music leaders teach gospel principles, but they do so primarily through music.\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce gospel principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. Songs that reinforce these principles are also suggested in\nCome, Follow Me\n.\nFor more information, see “\nInstructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation\n” in\nCome, Follow Me\n. See also\n12.1.6\nand\n12.3.4\nin this handbook.\nThe annual children’s sacrament meeting presentation is held during the last few months of the year. The children present what they have learned at home and at church during the year. They help the congregation focus on Heavenly Father, the Savior, and Their teachings.\nThe Primary presidency and music leader prayerfully plan the presentation. The bishopric gives direction. Children may sing, give talks, and share stories, scriptures, or testimonies.\nThe presentation may take all or part of the meeting time after the sacrament. Units with few children may invite children’s family members to participate.\nBecause of the sacredness of sacrament meeting, the presentation should not include visuals, costumes, or media presentations.\nFor more information, see “\nInstructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation\n” in\nCome, Follow Me\n.\nParents have the primary responsibility to teach their children about the temple and the priesthood. To support them, the Primary presidency plans a Temple and Priesthood Preparation meeting each year. The bishopric gives direction. The meeting is for children in the Valiant 10 class. Parents are invited. This meeting has the following purposes:\nHelp children understand priesthood purposes, responsibilities, and blessings.\nHelp children prepare to make and keep sacred covenants.\nTeach children the blessings and joy of participating in uniting families for eternity through temple and family history work (see\n1.2.4\n).\nHelp boys prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood.\nHelp children prepare to receive a temple recommend.\nThe meeting may be held during Primary on Sunday, at another time on Sunday, or at a different time. A member of the bishopric conducts. At least one member of the Primary presidency attends.\nIf a unit has few children, the meeting may be held under the direction of the stake presidency. Some or all of the wards in the stake meet together.\nFor more information, see\nTemple and Priesthood Preparation\non\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nParents have the primary responsibility to teach their children about baptism and confirmation. To support them, the Primary presidency plans a Baptism and Confirmation Preparation meeting near the beginning of each year. The bishopric gives direction.\nThis meeting is for children in the Valiant 7 class and their parents and teachers. The meeting has the following purposes:\nHelp children understand the covenant they make at baptism with Heavenly Father and the blessings they receive as they live that covenant.\nHelp children learn the importance of becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHelp children understand the gift of the Holy Ghost and how it can bless them.\nHelp children understand that when they partake of the sacrament, they renew their baptismal covenant.\nThe meeting may be held during Primary on Sunday, at another time on Sunday, or at a different time. A member of the bishopric conducts. At least one member of the Primary presidency attends.\nIf a unit has few children, the meeting may be held under the direction of the stake presidency. Some or all of the wards in the stake may meet together.\nGod invites all to come unto Christ and assist in His work by:\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nCaring for those in need.\nInviting all to receive the gospel.\nUniting families for eternity.\nPrimary helps children, families, leaders, and teachers participate in this work. For more information about God’s work of salvation and exaltation, study\nchapter 1\n.\nParents are responsible to teach their children the gospel and help them live it (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–28\n). Primary leaders and teachers support parents in this responsibility as follows:\nEnsure that Primary lessons, singing time, and service and activities help children follow the example of the Savior.\nHelp children prepare for baptism and confirmation.\nHelp boys prepare for priesthood ordination.\nHelp children prepare to receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances.\nTeach children about the blessings of sharing the gospel, including full-time missionary service.\nLeaders should be sensitive to children who lack family support for gospel living.\nParents and leaders strive to be good examples to children. They encourage children in their efforts to become more like Jesus Christ. The Children and Youth program is a resource to help children ages 8–11 (see\nChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nPrimary leaders and teachers encourage children and their families to learn the gospel at home. These leaders and teachers study the gospel and share with the children what they learn. They invite children to share at church what they are learning at home.\nSunday Primary meetings help children fulfill the purposes of Primary (see\n12.1.1\n). A member of the Primary presidency conducts the opening. The music leader conducts singing time. Primary teachers teach children during classes.\nPrimary meetings for children ages 3–11 are held every Sunday for 50 minutes while adults and youth attend their classes. The schedule is as follows:\nPart of Meeting\nLength\nPart of Meeting\nOpening (prayer, scripture or Article of Faith, and talk—all given by children)\nLength\n5 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nSinging time\nLength\n20 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nTransition to classes\nLength\n5 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nClasses and closing prayer\nLength\n20 minutes\nIn wards with many children, Primary leaders may divide children into two groups. One group is in classes while the other group is in singing time. Then the two groups change places. Leaders adjust the time as needed.\nNursery for children ages 18 months to 3 years lasts 50 minutes. The following schedule may be used. Leaders adjust it according to the needs of the children.\nPart of Meeting\nLength\nPart of Meeting\nWelcome by nursery leader and opening prayer by nursery child, if possible\nLength\n5 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nActivity (snack, play with simple toys and games, read, and so on)\nLength\n25 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nLesson from\nBehold Your Little Ones\nnursery manual\nLength\n10 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nSinging time\nLength\n10 minutes\nPart of Meeting\nClosing prayer\nActivities for All Children.\nPrimary presidencies may occasionally hold activities for all children ages 3 to 11. These activities help children participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. Activities should be fun and engaging. They build testimonies, strengthen families, and foster personal growth. For general activity guidelines, see\nchapter 20\n.\nPrimary presidencies may also organize an annual community service activity. Where possible, this activity focuses on serving children. Valiant-age children can help plan it. The activity provides children an opportunity to invite friends and ward members to join in community service.\nValiant Activities.\nBeginning in January of the year they turn 8, children may begin attending Valiant activities. Most Valiant activities are held at times other than Sundays or Monday evenings. Adult leaders help ensure that activities are safe (see\nsafety.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; see also\n20.7\nin this handbook). At least two responsible adult leaders must be present at all activities (see\n12.5.1\n).\nThe following guidelines may be adapted to local circumstances:\nValiant activities are held two times a month when possible. They can be held more or less frequently. Leaders consider family circumstances, travel distance and costs, and safety.\nGenerally, children are organized by age-groups. Boys and girls normally meet separately. However, they may combine for certain activities or in locations with few children.\nLeaders may choose to plan and hold annual day camps for these children. Valiant activities, including day camps, do not include overnight stays.\nAll supplies and activities, including day camps, are paid for by the ward budget. Travel and expenses should not be excessive.\nThe bishopric ensures that the budget and activities for boys and girls in Primary are sufficient and equitable. Budget is allocated according to the number of children.\nFor more information, see\nChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. See also\nJustServe.org\n, where it is available. These resources provide service and activity ideas.\nIn their efforts to become more like the Savior, children—beginning in the year they turn 8—are invited to set goals to grow spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually (see\nLuke 2:52\n). With help from parents, children seek inspiration to discover what to work on. They make plans, act on their plans, and reflect on what they learn. Leaders offer support as needed. However, they should not track the children’s goals or progress.\nBeginning in the year they turn 8, children are encouraged to complete at least one goal in each of the four areas each year. They can use\nPersonal Development: Children’s Guidebook\nto set and record goals.\nFor more information, see\nChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nChildren should have regular opportunities to serve others in and with their families and during Primary activities. Ideas for service can be found at\nChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Where it is available,\nJustServe.org\nsuggests opportunities for service in the community.\nChildren can invite all to receive the gospel in many ways. Some of these ways are listed below:\nSet a good example as disciples of Jesus Christ.\nShare their testimonies with friends and family members.\nMinister to less-active class members.\nInvite friends to attend church, activities, or baptisms or to be taught by the missionaries.\nInvite friends to participate in the Children and Youth program. Leaders work closely with parents of these children to help them understand the program and determine how they and their children would like to be involved.\nInvite friends and family members to attend the annual children’s sacrament meeting presentation.\nChildren can help unite families for eternity in many ways. Some of these ways are listed below:\nHonor their parents and set an example of Christlike living in their home.\nPrepare to have their own eternal family.\nStrive to be worthy to receive a temple recommend at the appropriate age.\nPrepare to make and keep covenants and receive temple ordinances, including eternal marriage.\nLearn about their extended families and ancestors.\nIdentify ancestors who need temple ordinances (see\nFamilySearch.org\n).\nPrepare to participate in proxy baptisms and confirmations in the temple.\nParticipate in family history volunteer activities with a family member (see\n25.4.3\n).\nThe bishop’s foremost responsibility is for the\nrising generation\nin his ward. The bishop or an assigned counselor meets regularly with the Primary president.\nThe bishop and his counselors respond promptly to recommendations from the Primary presidency for those to be called to serve in Primary. The bishopric works with the presidency to maintain continuity in teachers and music leaders. When possible, members in these callings should serve long enough to establish loving, trusted relationships with the children. Such relationships help nourish testimonies in the hearts of children.\nThe bishop and his counselors regularly attend Primary. They also learn the names and understand the home circumstances of each child in the ward.\nThe bishop calls and sets apart an adult woman to serve as the ward Primary president. If the unit is large enough, she recommends one or two adult women to be called as her counselors (see\nchapter 30\n). The bishopric considers her recommendations and extends the callings.\nThe Primary presidency receives orientation and ongoing support from the stake Primary presidency.\nIn a small unit, the Primary president may be the only called leader in Primary. In this case, she works with parents to organize lessons, singing time, and activities. She also ensures that at least two responsible adults are present at all meetings and activities. If the unit is large enough, additional callings might be filled in this order: counselors, music leader, teachers and nursery leaders, secretary, and activity leaders.\nIf a branch does not have a Primary president, the Relief Society president may help parents organize instruction for children until a Primary president is called.\nThe Primary presidency helps parents prepare children to enter and progress along the covenant path. This is one of their most important responsibilities.\nTo accomplish this, the Primary president may assign a member of the presidency to help parents prepare their children to be baptized and confirmed. The Primary president may assign another presidency member to help parents with temple and priesthood preparation for their children.\nThese presidency members make parents aware of resources in the Gospel Library that can help. See, for example, “\nPreparing Your Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n” in\nCome, Follow Me\n. Presidency members may work with ministering brothers and sisters, teachers, and others to support parents.\nThe Primary president has the following additional responsibilities. Her counselors assist her.\nServe on the ward council. She serves as (1) a ward council member who helps address needs in the ward and find solutions and (2) a representative of the Primary.

Jesus Christ taught, “Behold your little ones” and “feed my lambs” (\n3 Nephi 17:23\n;\nJohn 21:15\n). By following these invitations, Primary leaders love and teach children in the Savior’s way.\nThe Primary presidency recommends to the bishopric men and women to serve as Primary teachers and nursery leaders. The bishopric considers these recommendations and extends the callings. These members are called to teach and minister to specific age-groups of children.\nPrimary teachers teach from\nCome, Follow Me\n(ages 3–11). On fifth Sundays, they are encouraged to teach lessons from “\nAppendix B: For Primary—Preparing Your Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nNursery leaders teach from\nBehold Your Little Ones\n.\nTeachers and nursery leaders follow the principles in\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\nand\nchapter 17\nof this handbook.\nWhen adults teach children in Church settings, at least two responsible adults should be present.

They can also be other members the Primary presidency recommends and the bishopric calls. At least two leaders attend each activity. Leaders can be two women, two men, or a married couple. Leaders must complete the training at\nProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. (See\n12.5.1\n.)\nThe stake presidency calls an adult woman to serve as stake Primary president. If a stake is large enough, she recommends one or two adult women to serve as counselors and another to serve as secretary. These women are called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor. For information about the responsibilities of the stake Primary presidency and secretary, see\n6.7.1\n,\n6.7.1.3\n, and\n6.7.3\n.\nA counselor in the stake presidency has responsibility for Primary in the stake. He also has responsibility for the work of the stake Primary presidency. He also instructs bishops in their responsibilities for Primary.\nThe stake presidency assigns a high councilor to work with the stake Primary presidency (see\n6.5\n).\nWhen adults are interacting with children in Church settings, at least two responsible adults should be present. It may be necessary to combine classes to make this possible.\nAll adults who work with children must complete the children and youth protection training within one month of being sustained (\nProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). They repeat the training every three years thereafter.\nWhen a child has a long illness, disability, or special need, Primary leaders talk with parents and the bishopric. Together they make a plan to support the family and help the child participate in Primary.\nChildren with disabilities typically attend their regular Primary class. As necessary, additional teachers may be called to assist.\nChildren with disabilities or other special needs typically complete Primary at the beginning of January in the year they turn 12. Some children may not complete Primary on this schedule. The bishop and parents work together to decide what is best for each child.\nFor more information, see\ndisability.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; see also\n38.8.27\nin this handbook.\nThe bishopric and Primary presidency should remember the positive influence of worthy men serving in Primary. Men may serve as teachers, nursery leaders, music leaders and pianists, and Valiant activity leaders.\nLeaders and teachers should encourage parents to take their children to the restroom before Primary. During Primary, a young child must be taken to the restroom by a parent or legal guardian. Leaders and teachers should not take children into the restroom.\nLeaders and teachers should be careful when acting out sacred events in Primary. Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost are not portrayed. Children may portray the Savior only in a Nativity scene. For additional guidelines, see\n20.5.6\n.\nWhen children begin the CTR 4 class, the Primary presidency and their Primary teacher remind them to “choose the right.” These leaders also give each child a green\nCTR ring\n.\nAt the beginning of each year, the bishop, one of his counselors, or members of the Primary presidency may visit the home or Primary class of each child who will turn 8 during the year.
